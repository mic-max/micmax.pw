Sometimes, all I think about is you
...
Usually, I put something on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly in Hollywood
Laying on the screen
...
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye
