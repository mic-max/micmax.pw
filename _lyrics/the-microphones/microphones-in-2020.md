one moment thinking I'm wise
and in the next one I writhe,
trying to re-remind myself of something
learned then forgotten. Countless sunrises
burying the things I'd figured out the day before.
...
Spending hours each morning reading poems and staring off
and then snapping back to urgency, I did my dishes
then I would sprint to the studio again.
...
these wild swipes at meaning
...
I will never stop singing this song. It goes on forever.
