During a conversation with someone off a gummy so I was feeling very empathetic and they were telling a story about someone and said something along the lines of "oh you're one of these kinds of people". And I immediately was like "ouch", maybe that's fragile individualism ego of America but I thought it was pretty harsh. Kinda just sketched this idea up quickly in a rage.
