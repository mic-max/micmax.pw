I drew this from memory on the clipper ferry back to Seattle from visiting my concussed sister in Victoria for a week. I had a dream that week I was at their concert and their grand finale was [We Will Rock You](https://youtu.be/-tJYN-eG1zk) which inspired me to recreate this album's artwork, done from memory!
