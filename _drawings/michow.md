Before falling asleep in a melatonin daze I had the idea of going to some event where you put on a nametag and I would just mine to the shape of a cow and make the spots to form the letters of my name. Michael also kind of sounds like my cow, if you pronounce it like a toddler. I got up and sketch a rough concept which I minorly improved the next day and got this.
