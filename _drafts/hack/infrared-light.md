How to use infrared light with arduino or something

- Decode some of my existing remotes and maybe make a universal one?
  - simple audio listen remote.
  - automatically turn on when my computer wakes. run some script that communicates with the IR arduino and turn on, on windows wake/startup? I think it can also put itself to sleep, so maybe check whether my PC is connected to the speakers over BT every X seconds and if not, try turning the speakers on over IR.
- Or one wall mounted pointed in the direction of the receiving sensor that I can send commands using HTTP requests

links? i haven't looked much at these.
