How to use infrared light with arduino or something

- Decode some of my existing remotes and maybe make a universal one?
  - simple audio listen remote. I need a button battery.
- Or one wall mounted pointed in the direction of the receiving sensor that I can send commands using HTTP requests

links? i haven't looked much at these.
