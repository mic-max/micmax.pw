You can also easily checkout e-Books from your local library. As I just remembered! My friend @mattcloutier and I actually went on a day trip to some spots in Seattle not too long ago, the first being, the [Seattle Public Library](https://www.spl.org/) and scored ourselves some [library cards](https://youtu.be/lyxEDSnegTU)! However, the limited quantity of copies might require you to wait on hold for some time... In that case :skull:
