title: Laser Morse Code
---

connect laser to computer (arduino) and send morse code messages to someone far away.
have a receiver on the other end decoding it with a camera or light sensor. start with just 1 way communication, then 2 way if I'm not a lazy/cheap/pathetic blob

someone on youtube had a similar setup where he reflected a laser off a mirror at a known distance to calculate the speed of light.

notes:

- light does not have to be visible
- what are ideal conditions? no precipitation, at night
- what is the range
- add some error correcting / redundency
