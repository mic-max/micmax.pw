Converting my CRT that has a built-in VCR into the most portable melee setup you've ever seen

TODO Table of contents

- Rip out the VCR
- Put a Wii in its place
- Gamecube controller ports MUST be accessible from front of TV
- Gamecube memory card slots SHOULD be easily accessible
- Built-in Wii sensor bar, or just two IR LEDs if that is easier
- Make sure all buttons work
- Make a controller, the TV didn't come with one...
- Ensure adequate cooling for the Wii
- Should be able to easily play all games. Either load them all via some hack or have the disk reader easily accessible
- Connect Wii internally. No outside video inputs are necessary
- Power button could control both the Wii and the TV
- If possible make navigating to GameCube games from power-on not require the use of a Wii controller.
  - By default load into Melee versus, if a controller is holding a certain button combination?
- Add better handles to carry the TV
- Get a power adapter and plug both the TV and Wii into it, pass that cable through the chassis.
  - Will likely need to cut and splice together cable since it will be quite long
  - Make the cable retractable so carrying when I carry it around a cable isn't dangling around
- Add artwork to the outside of the case :)
- Place to store 2+ controllers while not in use?
- Paint exterior, plasti dip? Like GOML 2017 CRTs

## Documenting the process

So far I've already tried without any manual to tear down the TV to its individual parts as much as possible.
I did this on June 22 and have had it disassembled in my closet ever since and only playing melee at my friend Jon's place on his Slippi setup. It is time to reassemble and get back that sweet, sweet, electron beam display.

Model: Toshiba MV13P3
Manufacture Date: January 2004

*Include text and photos of anything writen on the TV case since I don't want to open again and will take off the stickers*

## CRT Purchase

So I moved to Seattle in the summer of 2019. I brought a lot of random, probably unnecessary electronics with me. Alas, I wasn't foolish enough to bring a 40lb CRT television set with me. (Later I found out my Dad had tossed it ðŸ˜¢)
I did have my GameCube, and all its games for some reason though... This is my original GameCube I received for Christmas as a child. I thought about using that, but the pros of using a Wii: size, higher performance, backward compatible / more games, smaller form factor all made that a no brainer.
I had my controller since I have a USB adapter for my PC to play on an emulator.
After quite a bit of searching on Craigslist for a CRT finally on the night of September 17, 2020 I made the trek up to Mercer and 13th Ave E in Capitol Hill. You might think I remember the time and place so vividly because this was such an impactful moment in my life, and you're right. I also happened to have paid on Venmo, still have the transaction and have my Google Maps Timeline enabled. Best $25 USD I've ever spent. Thanks to fellow Melee player Julian Bachetti ðŸ’™.

## The Christmas Wii Heist

When I return home for Christmas I need to lift the family Wii without rising suspicion. This will be a dubious task but one I am willing to take on. Should I fail this mission I accept all the consequences. The fruits of this heist are worth it.

*Story of me stealing the Wii*

## Teardown

This process is dangerous since the power supply is exposed on the inside of the TV.
It hasn't been plugged into power for months though, so *fingers crossed* I don't die while drafting this post.

### Cleaning

This bad boy likely hasn't been cracked open for 2021 - 2004 years so there is a lot of dust and other nasty stuff inside it. I did find a crusty spider carcass inside...

I need to make sure the TV still works after taking it apart before I waste any time trying to modify a dead thing. I think that might even be illegal in my state...

## Modification

The VCR component is roughly the same size of a Wii, so I'm hoping that it can slot right in there.

## Software Install

My buddy Jon will be taking care of setting up all the software stuff since he expressed interest in the project and already has some experience doing some very illegal Wii homebrew jobs in his dark past.
