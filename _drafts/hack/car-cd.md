My Kit

- [Gotega External DVD Drive](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MJW5BXZ)
- [Verbatim CD-R 700MB 52X](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001V5LCC8)

My first attempt was to burn FLAC files to my CD-R, thinking that these are the highest quality files so will make the best possible CD. Although that may be true, it isn't really the best CD if the device I'm using cannot read that file format. Investigating into what a 2010 BMW CD player can read uncovered [this site](#TODO)

burn in a way that time between tracks is removed? so it can play full albums that the end of a song leads into the next.

What's up with CD advertising they can hold 700MB but when I go to burn music it says I have a maximum of 80 minutes. Which is it!
