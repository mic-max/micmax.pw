title: The Beatles - Framed Posters
---

The had to properly represent and recognise the best band of all time in my domicile. Of course, that is The Beatles as you know from not only reading the title of this post but your own fine judgement!

My Dad's best friend Shawn Steele gifted me several The Beatles vinyl records. He purchased them as a kid and had been in his collection ever since. Inside some of them were included artwork.

Another one of my Dad's friends gifted me other The Beatles vinyls and I actually ended up with a duplicate of the white album which I gave to my friend @yelli_r.

<!-- try to figure out which ones shawn got me and which the arts came in -->

I had them professionally framed at [Blick Art Materials](https://www.dickblick.com/stores/washington/seattle/) on Broadway in Seattle during a frame sale. I chose all the specifics, frame type, backdrop colour and spacing, floats, etc. with guidance of the employee.

The portraits are separate pieces so the young woman employee and the older man had a bit of a moment when I explained that I wanted to the order from top left to bottom right be John, Paul, Ringo, George to match the Let It Be album cover.

I want to have these with me for the rest of my life since they are quite meaningful. So although I learned from this that framing can be expensive I'm glad I did it and happy with my decision.

$500 USD by the way.

## Portrait

Some mornings while brushing my teeth I'll look into the eyes of each Beatle. Especially John and Paul since they match perfectly up to my eye level.

Sizing.

## John Lennon on Piano

This was the third poster I received but decided not to frame yet.
