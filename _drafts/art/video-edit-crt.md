title: CRT Video Edit
---

I took a video on 12/15/2021 or 16 ok my CRT monitor
use video editing software to put something playing on the TV, maybe the land before time sweeping in like a bird on a landscape
motion track a cut out of the CRT, replace with another video's contents

There's also something called circuit bending that you can do with a digital camera, I could get an old one and try get some cool screwed up footage.
