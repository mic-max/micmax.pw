Here are some things I've drawn. I enjoy drawing and find it pretty relaxing to just focus on it and ignore the outside world until I am finished. These are mostly all with markers I picked up in early 2021 from Blick in Capitol Hill. Now I can remove my Instagram Highlight called `create` and preserve this monumental artwork for millennia ðŸ˜Œ.

- Rude Dog
This is from a cartoon that my sisters and I would watch at my grandparents house called Rude Dog & The Dweebs.
Here's a link to [episode 1](https://youtu.be/aj3XSmBcOHs), at least give the introduction a watch ðŸ˜…

- Axolotls
One of my favourite animals. I did a speech on Mexican Axolotls in grade 5 after seeing them in a magazine and being fascinated about how looked. I also got a pencil case from a store in Bellevue which is what I used to store my markers, and this is a recreation of that design.

- Zoboomafoo
Another classic television show from my childhood. This actually became my online identity starting as my Xbox Live Gamertag and becoming most of my usernames until I started using the alias `micmax`. Lemurs are my favourite animal and I drew this on a weekend trip to Pacific City, Oregon with friends. I'm not too happy how this one turned out, I feel I used to much solid colour.
My friends Yushi and Tristan took this photo of me while I was drawing it.

- Donnie Darko
One of my favourite movies, I remember first watching this with my older sister Heather and being so confused as a kid. I've rewatched it a bunch of times since, went as Donnie for Hallowe'en in 2017, and during my last rewatch session at 2AM was inspired to draw this.

- Mom Jeans
My friend Eric suggested that I draw this after seeing something I drew that reminded him of it I believe. Mom Jeans is a band and I guess they like skateboarding dogs, I mean who doesn't!

- Strawberry Fields
One of my favourite songs, I wanted to personify the berries. I really love this one.

- Caterpilar Sleeping Bag
My friends and I camped out the night before hiking Mt. St. Helens. I did not have a sleeping bag. I bought a sleeping bag. It had a place to put a paper. I drew on that paper.

- Arthur at the Dump
From a classic scene in the TV show Arthur etched into my memory where he goes to the dump to get a new bike wheel. Painted this thanks to my friend Danielle for driving me and providing all the supplies on the hill at Gas Works park. It actually isn't done yet but here it is!
