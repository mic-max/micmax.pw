title: Halloween Store Music Video
---

I really like this song and heard it for the first time earlier this year. Probably my favourite song of the year. I don't think it would be too hard to make a music video for it too since it is quite explanatory about what is going on. I'd only have to rack my brain for some creativity to fill in the music-only segments of the song.

Film around mid October.
Rent 1 cool oldish red convertible for an afternoon
Access to a blue generic car - VW Jetta, Toyota Carolla, etc.
2 actors: one plays norm, other plays the woman
Scenes: Apartment, Halloween store interior, Halloween store parking lot, streets (houses with lots of decorations)
Costume:

Song Segments

0:00 - 0:21
*Music Only*

0:21 - 0:27
Halloween is just around the corner
I was thinking today

{
    Calendar?
}

0:28 - 0:34
Sat around getting high all afternoon
Wondering what I should wear

{
    Slideshow of different costumes play in a thought bubble above head
}

0:34 - 41
Eventually, I picked myself up
Put on my shoes and walked out the door

{
    Literally picking himself out of the chair
    Closeup of slipping on shoes (I feel like someone who gets high all afternoon doesn't tie them each time)
    Open and closing door (What angle)
}

0:42 - 0:51
I had one destination in mind
And that destination was the Halloween store

{
    Walking to where the car was parked with purpose
    Look directly at camera to say the Halloween store lyric
    Camera stops moving once eye contact is made and he walks out of frame
}

0:52 - 1:02
*Music Only*

{
    Walking by halloween decorations
}

1:03 - 1:09
I started my car and as I did
I wondered if I'd locked the house

{
    Get in car (red - since there is a blue car it will be parked next to later) - cool car could rent on turo? convertible? needs to have lock that pulls up.
    Closeup of keys in ignition starting car
    Maybe try to include a view of them in the shot of him walking away from car
    (leave keys in ignition or maybe on the seat?)
}

1:10 - 1:16
Walked back and found that I hadn't
But now my keys were in the car

{
    Exact same shots as going to the car but walking faster? and quicker cuts?
    Get to the house door and he realises it is not locked and makes an expression that is fuck now i forget the keys!
}

1:17 - 1:30
Walked to the car, pulled the handle
And it snapped back, at least, I'd locked one door
Reached my hand through the open window
Pulled the lock, forgot about the house
And drove to the Halloween store

{
    Walking back to the car shots
    Try to open car door but its locked, reach in through the open window to lift up the lock
    Car pulling away
    Shots from inside car
    Shots from another car matching the speed
}

1:31 - 1:43
*Music Only*

{
    Driving shots?
    Houses with decorations
}

1:44 - 1:49
I pulled into the lot and parked
Next to a blue car like yours

{
    He pulls into lot with view of a halloween store in background
    Next to a generic blue car (ex: vw jetta)
    Looks over at car and ponders for a moment
}

1:50 - 1:56
Looked in my rearview mirror
Imagining meeting you in an aisle

{
    Cameraman in backseat with a shot of making eye contact in the rear view
    Guy is daydreaming
    Include a hazy shot of them meeting in an aisle of the store
}

1:57 - 2:02
I said "Hi, I'm Norm, I think we've maybe met once before"

{
    Shot of him only saying the line (indicating he's the only one there)
}

2:02 - 2:13
And as my fog cleared, I realized
That you were sitting in your car
Smiling at me at the Halloween store

{
    Fog machine in the store making the fog literally clear?
    Cut back to him in car rearview snapping back to reality
    Looking back to the blue car (to his left, cars parked driver window to driver window?) 
    Now there's a woman in the blue car smiling
}

2:14 - 2:59
