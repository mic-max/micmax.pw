analog clock in background of 3d printing timelapses

best 3d printing timelapses
- tripod
- hd camera, doesn't need to be crazy high res though.
- send extruder to corner each layer then use that shot
- a moving camera!
- multiple angles, or that could be achieved by doing the print multiple times.
- good lighting
- nothing accidentally moving in background. clouds or a sunset or stars in bg would rock though.
- how to stitch together in software
  - photos instead of a video right?
- camera battery life must be greater than print time or we'd have to plug into DC power
- changes to lighting? if done in non controlled environment e.g. outside.
- audio... printing sounds muted? music? wind, rain, snow, etc.
- candle burning in background?

camera pans with the layer height: could be done in post?

how much time to show the final product after its done printing?
- 1 second? 2? almost none? depend on the vibe of the video?

greenery in background looks nice

bokeh for low depth of field portraits?
each layer doesnt take the same time to print. 
no light flickering.

timelapse looks like im printing a bad word but then convert back to something family christian friendly

top down angle
manual focus - put a similar object on print bed to help with this
how to start and finish them...
pull them off the bed?
 - when switching from photographs to video the image might look slightly different. crop and adjust lighting to make it appear seamless

stop frame animation with the model after it is complete?

show dont tell
some jump cut where they appear in my hand?

have a time counter and filament used number increasing on screen?

green screen
lighting constrasts the filament well. makes it the focus of attention rather than anything else in the frame
2 tone filament and shiny ones will look cool
video transition into the printing segment! a little splash screen kinda thing. not too obtrusive.
more interesting infill patterns

automated lazy susan. capture a full 360 of photos. camera takes photo every 2 seconds. lazy susan rotates
 1 degree every 2 seconds. or do something where camera is connected to pc. it takes photo. and detects when photo is complete. then
 activates the rotation. and repeats... until 360 times. maybe get a few extra degrees to be safe

print bed orientation in most interesting angle for camera to see

simulate the day and night cycle if its a daylong print?
how to sync camera with 3d printer?
or just take pic every 2s and pause the print head to the corner for 2s
use the actual 3d model to do some graphical effects
timing of audio track with print. maybe it has a good BPM for the print if thats possible?
variable speedups
