Take modern photos of Seattle and put them next to historic ones (or other cities)
Can also edit them to resemble the older ones to learn something about photo editing
Took a photo of a photo at top pot on dec 13, 2021 of first hill from a long time ago. line this up. identify current buildings. I think the church is St. James.
