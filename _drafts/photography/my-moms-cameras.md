I found all these cameras on the floor of the front closet which I mainly think of as the vacuum closet. I had looked through it months ago but only investigated the top shelf. Let's try to get these cameras back into tip top shape :circle:

### Digitisation

[VHS conversion station at Cumberland branch](https://biblioottawalibrary.ca/en/music-editing-and-vhs-conversion-stations-cumberland)
Machine only accepts regular VHS tapes, I would need a [VHS-C adapter](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00QV2T6II).

Can I digitise and reuse any old tapes I find? Or will they be degraded

## Minolta XG-M
