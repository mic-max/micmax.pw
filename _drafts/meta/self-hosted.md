title: Self Hosting
---

I decided to use non-proprietary sites like medium.com so I could have full control over my content and be able to customize to my heart's content. That's part of the fun of running a blog after all, right? I'm not sure this is my first time. I personally feel everyone should have their own websites instead of using these social media platforms like twitter, facebook, instagram, etc. but we're not there yet.
