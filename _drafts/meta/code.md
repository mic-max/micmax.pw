How to store source code on a blog.
- <region> markers in the code
- Just copy paste it and if it gets out of sync so be it.
- Gist? Have another repository called `blog-code` that is imported as a git module by this one, then code can be included in the build process

Rendering
- Use monospace font
- Syntax highlighting and maybe some other things like bracket colour coordinating?
- Line numbers
- Button to copy the entire contents of the code block
