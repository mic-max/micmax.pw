Time to think boxes.

I have the [Kallax Ikea Shelf Unit](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/kallax-shelf-unit-walnut-effect-light-gray-10360134/). It is a [locality in Sweden](https://goo.gl/maps/nTKMhcncgb1CphfY7) supposedly named after a combination of the words fish and bay in Finnish. The inner dimensions of each shelf is 13.25" (W) x 13.25" (H) x 15.25" (D). The standard dimensions of an album sleeve is 12.375" x 12.375". That leaves 0.4375" for the wood sides which must include some wiggle room. That means the wood thickness likely need be 0.375" or less.

The sides can be different dimensions than the bottom since they only affect how many records can be kept in the bin and there only being a bottom panel its thickness could be double that of the side panels.

## Proper Vinyl Storage Tips

## Materials

I only needed some 11/32" plywood. I bought a 48" x 96" board from Home Depot for $42. This should be able to make 4 boxes assuming I don't make big mistakes. Averaging a little over $10 each. I had to venture to West Seattle since saw at the one in SoDo was out of order. Getting smaller plywood would have not only been more expensive but since they come in 2' x 4' or 4' x 4' then I would only get 3 and 9 panels respectively. Instead of getting 21

| Width | Length | Cost | Panels Yielded | Cost per Panel | Cost per Box |
| 24" | 48" | $TODO | 3 | |
| 48" | 48" | $TODO | 9 | |
| 48" | 96" | $42 | 21 | |

Making something with dimensions slightly above a foot is not ideal but necessary for it to fit records.

Smaller plywood is created for smaller projects so they are prettier.

### Handle Holes

Laser cutter
Did not have the focusing tool. Make sure wood is square with laser.

A rounded sides 4" (W) x 1" (H) located in the centre 1.5" from the top.

Should the bottom panel be completely inside the walls? for strength, looks, etc.

Should I use a plunge router instead? or mill/drillpress?
