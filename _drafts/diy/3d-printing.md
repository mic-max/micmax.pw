title: 3D Printing
---

For Christmas my Mom & Dad gifted me a 3D printer. On Black Friday I ordered the `Ender 5 Pro` with 1 Kg spools of both black and white PLA filament. Sorry, but I wasn't actually able to contain my excitement until [Jesus' supposed Birthday](https://www.ucg.org/the-good-news/biblical-evidence-shows-jesus-christ-wasnt-born-on-dec-25) to use it :smiley:

I've never used one before and the only experience I have 3D modelling was a couple days in Grade 9 tech class using `AutoCAD` to design a rudimentary airplane. I'm excited for all the possibilities having a 3D printer will unlock. There are several 3D printers at the Microsoft Garage in Redmond that I could also be making use of... then again, most of my inspiration comes at unopportune times.

## Why 3D Print Stuff

It's a great and simple enough way to make things. The things you can make are only limited to the size of the printing area, the filament materials, physics, your imagination, and [CAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design) skills.

I can definitely see more households getting 3D printers in the future. I'm sure it has gotten loads easier in the past several years, but an easy mode and directory/catalog of parts to print or scanning something to duplicate with your phone would really elevate the accessibility. You can create so many things out of a common resource, being the plastic filament. It would also reduce the amount of shipping that occurs. Say you needed to buy a soap dish, a hair clip, and a tiny thingamajigger for your dishwasher that you can only get from this one store 40 minutes away and they are out of stock and it costs like $50. That sounds kinda lame. You would have to drive to 3 different stores or have them all delivered. I imagine that carbon footprint is pretty large for the comparatively small items you need. A more efficient way to get these items if you already had a 3D printer would be to download some 3D models, that hopefully already exist, and buy a multipurpose spool of plastic and run the printer overnight. The shipping cost then becomes more like a one-time fee for the spool and the prints are probably faster than someone driving it to your doorstep anyway.

This is likely an oversimplification, not including how plastic is made. I haven't seen that episode yet.

In summary here's what I feel is good and what is bad about 3D printing

Pros:

- Customisable
- Smaller environmental impact due to less shipping (electricity costs?)
- Potentially faster than buying from a store or online
- More convenient
- Learning :neckbeard:

Cons:

- Ease of use (calibrating perfect settings, needing a computer with specific software and an SD card to transfer the files)
- Small size items only
- Smaller scale operations, injection molding plastic is much more efficient at high scale

## Unboxing + Building + Setup

First of all I need to unbox and build the printer. This ended up being much easier than I anticipated. As much of the printer was already pre-assembled as possible and only required me to screw in the base to the top, add the print bed, control unit with screen, and connect all the cables. The cables were pretty well labelled, but I still managed to mix up the print head thermistor with the print bed thermistor :joy: The packaging was also superb and included a 200g spool of PLA to get started.

## First Print

Now that the construction part is complete, I'll run a test print!
Since this is the first print, I must calibrate the print head to be only slightly above the print bed in its home position. Once done that I set the extruder temperature to 200 degrees celcius and guide the filament through the tube to the print head until some begins to extrude.
The printer came with a micro SD card and a USB adapter for it. The files included on it were the Creality Slicer application, several STL files and some already pre-sliced files.
I decided to go with the 10x10 maze since it only takes an hour to complete and uses minimal filament, since my goal was just to see if the thing worked.
After slicing and exporting the file to the micro SD card, I plugged it into the Ender 5 Pro and selected from the menu to load 1

## Projector Feet

In my bedroom I have a projector (that Amazon refunded because they thought I never received it) up on a shelf pointed at my uneven wall. The angle adjust on the projector only elevates the front side and I need to angle it downwards. Poor planning on my part for at what height I decided to mount the shelf, maybe, but let's not play the blame game. I had been using some Ottawa Senators coasters to prop up the backside which worked fine, but not ideal. So, I took some measurements of how tall I needed the feet to be and once again avoided learning how to 3D model something myself and moseyed on over to <thingiverse.com> :smiling_imp:

Luckily there's millions of people on this earth and at least one of them ran into the same challenge as me and was kind enough to share their 3D printed solution :heart_eyes:
Here's the `thing` that I used: [Projector Feet Prop 2 Inches](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2843526). I loaded the `.stl` file into Creality Slicer, rotated it so the base of the cone-like object was on the bottom and laying flat on the printer bed. Then scaled it down to about half size since I only needed an elevation of `~26mm` rather than `2"`. I then duplicated the object so it would print 2 of them at once. An hour later I was scrapeing the feet off the print bed and removing the support structure. These feet are ready for prime time!

I also have the keystone correction maxed out :joy:

## Soap Dish

I have a noted down a few ideas for things to print already, one of those is a soap dish. I am sick and tired of my soap becoming a mushy blob after sitting on the side of my bath. I found many soap dish models online, but I thought [this model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4773343) in particular was coolest. It's summary:
> This soap dish is formed using the “Weaire–Phelan structure,” the most mathematically efficient way for equal-sized bubbles to fit together to make foam.

If your bar of soap made perfect bubbles, this is what they would look like!

The structure is made up of two pentagonal dodecahedra (12-sided) and six tetrakaidecahedra (14-sided) that form a translation unit with a lattice periodicity which is simple cubic. In crystallography, this structure is also known as the A15 Frank-Kasper phase.

See my main page for some other designs based on the Weaire–Phelan structure.

There is a good introduction to the “Weaire–Phelan structure” here: <http://www.steelpillow.com/polyhedra/wp/wp.html>

## Pottery Stamp

So my friend @yelli_r 's pottery teacher wanted to sign her pottery with a stamp instead of by hand each time.

So I have the task of designing and printing a 3D stamp meant for clay in exchange for a cool mug!

This reminds me of (one of) the first time(s) I earned money from programming back in the summer of spring of 2015 someone I was going to be classmates with at University I met online was building a site for a client in PHP and I helped provide the email form code and he e-transfered me $20 CAD for my time. I was officially a professional programmer!

## Bear Spray Safety Clip

## Shower Knob

I broke my shower tap. Now it is just an exposed screw with a nut on it. Luckily I had a spare wrench and have been using that.
It's not very classy or as convenient though. Time to print something up!

## Switch Mount

## Power Strip Mount

## Now Spinning Shelf

## Conclusion

I will definitely have a mindset of can I build this myself now whenever I have the desire to buy something. Not only would it be more fun to do, it could also be more convenient depending on the circumstances and also self-sufficient. If you want something done right, do it yourself :joy:
