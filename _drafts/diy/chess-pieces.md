title: Chess Pieces
---

Recently, I've been playing a ton of chess. It's history, difficulty, and universality are all aspects which have drawn me in. I mostly play online but figured having a physical set would be cool and come in handy :crown:

## Chess

Why did I decide to start playing chess and try to improve?
I used to play with my Mom and also I come to find out my Dad was in the chess club in high school.

First off, because it's fun. I enjoy playing games and learning new openings and strategies, it gives me something to study now that I'm no longer in school.
The game been played for centuries in its current form.

Picturing myself (combating senality) in an old folks home playing chess and dominating the squares brings me a weird amount of comfort. Maybe its that in this hypothetical I've trained a skill for decades or maybe it's simply that I made it to my old age and got to experience all stages of life. Anyways, chess isn't going anywhere any time soon and also with the big spike in popularity over the past years likely attributed to The Queen's Gambit series on Netflix means there's more players than ever to [Fried Liver](https://www.chess.com/article/view/fried-liver-attack-chess-opening) online :devil:

Additionally, no technology is needed to play, it is accessible, competitive head-to-head game, high skill ceiling, ability to play with someone who doesn't speak your language, and worldwide prevelance are some other reasons I think chess is cool :nerd:

## 3D Printing Pieces

I found [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:40605) full size traditional Staunton chess set and spent lots of time printing both sides pieces.
I had issues using the full bed of my printer since the wires and filament tube would get caught when reaching into the far corner.
To aleviate this I only printed a few pieces at a time near the centre. This was fine since I was home all day working and could start a
I also printed an extra queen for each colour.
The `Thing` also includes files to print the board, but I think it would be better to make one from wood. Stay tuned.

Making the walls too thin can lead to letting some light in to see the weight inside. This would make it ugly and is a no go!

<https://www.fictiv.com/articles/recommended-wall-thickness-for-3d-printing#:~:text=A%20good%20minimum%20wall%20thickness%20for%203D%20printing%20PLA%20is%201.5%20mm.>

## Weighted Pieces

After playing a couple games with the set, I decided they would feel a lot better if they were heavier.
Luckily the design has a hollowed bottom, which makes sense to save printing material.
This will also make the pieces bottom heavy which will make them harder to knock over due to a low centre of mass.

## Comparing Weighting Methods

I cooked up two devious plans to fatten up my pieces.

1. Hide money in them - [The George Bluth Sr. Classic](https://youtu.be/04SLXwjJvqg)
2. [Smash, smash, smash](https://youtu.be/wDQTvuP1Dgs) some lead into them
3. Melt a heavy element, such as lead, into a mould and glue them in

I wanted to maximize the weight added, while still not blowing the bank, and also (as a massochist) learn new things!
Here are the results of some quick calculations provided my handy [TI-36X Pro](https://education.ti.com/en/products/calculators/scientific-calculators/ti-36x-pro).
For the coin strategy I simply tried to cram as many as I could into the bottom and maximize the mass. This would probably be a good candidate for some dynamic programming technique or calculus, but that's a tale for another day.

Either way I will be securing the weight with hot glue, which I already have, and putting a [felt bottom](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B096K5CFYK).

A happy side effect of doing this is it should reduce the manufacturing time of the pieces. 3D printers cannot move as much volume as the following methods, mine does only have a 0.4mm nozzle after all.

Note: The hollow part of the print should come together at a 45 degree angle to not cause the printer to have to print more of an overhang than it can. This is a balance between no undercut for the hollowed volume and no major overhang for the printed piece.

| Denomination | Value | Weight (g) | Diameter (mm) | Thickness (mm) | Composition        |
|--------------|-------|------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|

### 1a) Maximize Mass Strategy

| Piece   | Dimes | Pennies | Nickels | Quarters | Cost ($) | Mass (g) |
|---------|-------|---------|---------|----------|----------|----------|

Coins Required: 132 pennies
Total Value: $1.32
Total Mass: TODOg

### 2) Lead Strategy

First I needed to get the actual dimensions of the hollow rather than just jam coins in until I couldn't no more.
I'm a CAD beginner so I just used calipers even though using the STL file I could probably easily get the dimensions...
The hollow starts cylindrical and then becomes a cone. The depth is the total depth and the sill measurement is the depth which it goes from cylinder to cone.
Making the following kind of shape

```text
|    | Sill
\    / Cone
 \  /
  \/
```

Upon further inspection, the cylinder part actually slightly narrows from the base upwards. Since it is such a small I will just take the radius at the narrowest point.

Here's some formulas I used to measure the hollow's volume in a language I understand

```python
import math

def volume_cylinder(radius, height):
    return math.pi * math.pow(radius, 2) * height
    
def volume_cone(radius, height):
    return (1/3) * volume_cylinder(radius, height)
```

Hollow Dimensions:

k 24.8 25.18 23.3 24.84 25.18 24.8
3.56 3.81 3.51 3.44 3.7
27.01 26.7 26.9 27.44 26.9 26.5

lets use 12.3 mm radius
3.5 mm sill
23mm height

for q r b k since theyre all similar lets use the same mould
12 mm radius
3.5mm sill
11.5mm height

q 25.19 25.3 25.3
r 24.6 24.14 24.8 24.5 24.5

p 18.84 18.81 18.82
4.02

lets use 9.2mm radius
3.5mm sill
8.2 mm height

| Piece   | Radius (mm) | Depth (mm) | Sill (mm) | Area (cm^3) | Mass (g) | Cost ($) |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------|-------------|----------|----------|
| King    | 12.675      | 27.6       | 3.93      | 5.965       | 67.65    | 0.66     |
| Q,B,N,R | 12.87       | 15.35      | 3.86      | 4.002       | 45.38    | 0.44     |
| Pawn    | 9.60        | 12.4       | 3.91      | 1.951       | 22.13    | 0.22     |

Area Required: 107.184 cm^3
Lead Required: 1124.7 grams
Total Cost: $11?

There are also other ways to get lead. Wheel weights are used for balancing tires and usually made of lead. People post online about getting massive buckets from local mechanic shops at a great price.

The original mass of the King is `13.8 g` so adding `67.65 g` of lead will result in a `5.9x` heavier piece.

3) Other Elements

| Material | Density (g/cc) | Cost ($/g) | Melting Point (C) |
|----------|---|---|---|
| Tungsten | 19.30 | TODO | 3407 |
| Mercury  | 13.69 | TODO | -38.72 |
| Lead     | 11.34 | 0.0097 | 327.6 |
| PLA      | 1.24 | 0.025 | 180 |

Note: PLA density is for 100% infill. Lead cost is calculated from my actual [RotoMetals](https://www.rotometals.com/) order.

I will try to fill about 110 cm^3 of volume with the heaviest element I can safely and without absolutely destroying my wallet. First let's sort all elements by their density in descending order. Next, check how much 110 cm^3 of that element would cost and if the freezing/melting temperatures are acceptable. The foundry, mould, and housing (chess piece PLA) all have some limitations. Then pick the element in position zero.

If the melting temperature is too high to achieve easily, the option of buying small balls and [sphere packing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_packing) the gaps to about 74% full and filling the gaps with glue could be an option that might even end up being heavier. Sphere packing also allows skipping the mould and thus ignoring the undercut restriction. As long as there is a hole large enough for the balls to make it through to the next hollow cavity, such as the horses neck for example, it would increase the density. Using balls would also allow for the hollow opening to only be slightly larger than the size of ball used.

Would the balls make a rattle noise even when packed tight and glued?

PLA density is 1.24g/cc. So removing even 9cc of 100% infill plastic to fit 1cc of lead would yield a heavier piece.


### Tungsten - W

Tungsten is the densest element that isn't absorbidantly expensive. At $679 per litre according to [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prices_of_chemical_elements) would only be $75. It does have the highest melting point of all metals at 3,422Â°C. It can be bought in powder form that is typically mixed with resin or in a putty form. Commonly used for pinewood derby cars or in fishing.

[MSE Supplies 1mm Tungsten Balls](https://www.msesupplies.com/products/1mm-spherical-tungsten-carbide-wc-grinding-milling-media-balls?currency=USD&variant=22624905789498) are $43 for 100. The volume of each ball is: 4/3 * pi * r^3 where r is 0.5mm. Making each ball 0.523598776 mm^3 in volume. To fill a 110 cm^3 area with perfect sphere packing at 74% it would take 81,400 mm^3 which is 162,000 balls. Way too expensive LOL.

[Midwest Tungsten Service](https://shop.tungsten.com/tungsten-shot-1-pound-bag/) sells a pound of 1.78mm diameter balls for $110. 110cm^3 would take around 4.7 pounds costing $517. Density listed on the site is actually 17.6 g/cc.

The [OpenSCAD Chess Simple Printing](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3381939) files included CAD `.dxf` files which are a silhouette of the piece in 2D. I can modify this to introduce the cavity.

I can achieve a pawn heavier than 55g using lead. I think that is heavy enough.

### Mercury - Hg

Mercury is 13.53 g/cc. It's melting point is â38.8 Â°C so it will always be liquid unless taken to the arctic circle. Would it be able to be stored in a not very thick PLA piece? Being liquid is good because 100% of the hollow will be utilised.

### Lead - Pb

Okay, now that we've explored the fantasy land options, let's see the realistic one.

## Making the Mould

I found and read this article titled [How to Weight Chess Pieces at Home](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Weight-Chess-Pieces-at-Home/).

I had planned to make the mould out of wood, by drilling various depths and sized bits into a block of wood. This would be pretty hard
"No plan survives first contact with the enemy". my enemy was my own first bright idea. or planning itself. I also forgot that I could get access to a CNC mill.

Now my plan is to CNC mill a mould for the molten lead out of aluminum. It will be more precise, more reusable, and be easier to reproduce. All I need to do is get a chunk of aluminum, learn some basic CAD, and get access to the mill by doing some training.

The size of the aluminum block must be at the absolute minimum: 70.29mm x 25.74mm x 27.6mm. So would likely want to round this up to at least 1.5" x 1.5" x 4" so there can be at least some space between the different sized moulds in the same block.
Would I be able to use two smaller aluminum blocks welded together?

- need to make the mould slightly larger than the desired yeilded metal object?
  - "make sure you account for any anticipated [shrinkage](https://youtu.be/GG2dF5PS0bI) when the metal cools" <https://www.thecrucible.org/guides/metalworking/metal-casting/>

<https://www.grainger.com/product/GRAINGER-APPROVED-Aluminum-782RD3> 6 inch `$15.91` ($14.43 subtotal. Shipping takes almost 3 weeks. So does a local pickup!)
<https://www.amazon.com/Square-Aluminum-General-Purpose-Plate/dp/B09MH8Q6BT> 1 foot `$29.76`
<https://www.metalsdepot.com/aluminum-products/aluminum-square-bar> 1 foot, `$37.21` ($19.38 subtotal)

My new plan to expedite this project is to forego using the CNC mill at my work since I need to do a decent amount of training yet to access it and use a milling service.
Now I just need to send a model and some moneys to a company and wait for them to do the work.
I also don't have to source my own aluminum blocks and have the potential of screwing up several of them :laugh:

I just had the epiphany that I should first make a cylinder and then a cone, combine them, then do the subtraction on a rectangular prism.
Another edit! I can actually just use the extrude tool on the bottom face of the cone and it will works the same!
Prior to this revelation I was thinking of doing the subtractions individually.
Another thought that just popped in my head: maybe I could make a nesting type mould. Similar to Russian nesting dolls, I will make the largest mould, then have inserts that slide in an reduce the size. I assume this makes the milling and design process harder since I will have to make these conical shell shapes (kind of like a party hat) and if imperfect might not be good to pour liquid metal into if it gets lodged in a crack. It would save on space though. It would also likely cost more since each conical shell would presumably need to be made out of a solid block rather than being able to reuse the previously extracted cone, since it gets shredded my the mill at 17,000 RPM. Actually it would use less aluminum since each smaller shell can be made from a smaller piece of aluminum. Now my concern is having it work for smelting and secondly, if the added design complexity is still easy to produce from a CNC mill. For instance it might only be possible to mill on 5-axis mills, reducing the accessibility of the design, even though I will likely only ever make one of these it's an interesting perspective to keep in mind.

Maybe I will get a piece that goes in the top of the mould too so when I'm not using it it looks like a solid cube. I could also get the outer block engraved with something :thinking:

![Nesting Mould Concept](/assets/img/chess/nesting-mould.png)

<https://www.hubs.com/knowledge-base/reducing-cnc-machining-costs-design-tips/>

depth <= 3-4x the diameter of the milling bit
      6x + is considered too deep

min wall thickness 0.8mm

add a hole? use a standard diameter
 this would add more surface area for the lead to be in contact with plastic and epoxy or glue but it might just snap off...

make it a standard size of aluminum bar, so the only cuts are made to the cone part and not the shaping of the exterior walls with the cnc.

blank size: better to do long 1x6 or 2x6 shape?
  3mm must be removed from the outside. common stock sizes in quarters of inches so 1.25" x 1.25" we'd want to make the dimensions of the model 31.75mm - 3mm = 28.75mm at most.

make the walls of the mould angled outward to facilitate extraction of the cast

This video of casting lead in MoldMax 60 gave me the confidence to use it. The product specifies maximum temperatures of 294C but the melting point of lead is 328C. The man in the video claimed to use the mould 200 times and only had a small defect.

<https://www.smooth-on.com/product-line/mold-max/>

mold wall thickness? using 2mm now
line height .2mm is pretty visible on this particular object.

maybe random seem on the speckled filaments actually looks better than linear ones...
add draft to moldbox to make it easier to remove silicone mold, loft tool.
13mm to the top, what about around the exterior?

## Smelting

The melting point of [lead (Pb)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead) is `328 Â°C` which is relatively low for a metal.

I bought a [Lee Production Pot IV Electric Melter](https://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Do-it_Lead_Melting_Lee_Production_Pot_IV_/descpage-DILMPPIV.html) for $88 after taxes (which I _do_ pay) and shipping.
The alternative would have been to use a cast iron pot, blowtorch, and carefully laddel the molten metal.

- dont get any water in molten lead - it will explode
- use a mask, dont breathe in lead fumes
- use protective glasses

[Guide to Hand Sorting Wheel Weights](https://castboolits.gunloads.com/showthread.php?139839-Guide-to-Hand-Sorting-Wheel-Weights)

### Silicone

I poured about xx pawn weights from 1 of my ingots. yielded

After the first one, the rest started coming out with some of the melted mold attached.

It also took over a minute to solidify. Now if I am making weights for a whole chess set I'd rather not dedicate over 32 minutes of time sitting around some liquid lead. I will need more molds. 16 pawns, 4 of each of the other 4 pieces, and 2 kings. So a mold with one of each and 4 pawns could work. 9 total holes... Would cut casting time drastically.

Seeing the performance of Mold Max 60 for casting lead though I don't think I will use it unless I

- Don't care too much about finish and dimensions since each subsequent casting will deteriote the mold
- Cannot get an aluminum mold casted, either timing wise or cannot justify the cost

Casting also made me consider how flat I could get the bottom. Lead has quite a bit of surface tension and it tended to dry with a more shallow centre. Ideally this would not happen so I could get a flat bottom. I might have to make a two part mold and cut off the sprues to get a flatter bottom...

## Assembly

### Stand

I made a stand using a scrap piece of 18" x 8" 3/8" plywood and some ripped 2x4's for legs. I then cut some holes about xx in diameter with a hole saw (which I learned how to use thanks to youtuber XXX) and others with a spade bit. My hole saw kit doesn't have a starter hole for the smaller ones? So it wandered like crazy which can be seen at the corner with the black knight, poorly concealed with paint. Honestly the spade bit was better anyway, hole saw got really hot and the cut hole kept getting stuck in the saw. Going halfway through then switching to the order side helps with tearout. Dremelled out grooves for the knight pieces.

This would have been a perfect job for the laser cutter. Unfortunately, I have yet to complete the Ottawa Library laser cutter training. Perhaps for a v2. I would like to add 2 extra holes for the additional queen each side gets. I could also add design by etching or cutting out . Adjust hole spacing and layout to optimize for space. If I did all pawns on one side then, since they are shorter, I could use the underside space for a drawer? Or just make it a bit taller and add a full sized drawer! Maybe put my moulds in there? Knight holes will be defined, thus the orientation more obvious. Way to clamp to workbench? Use the actual 3D model to make the holes, account for the bottoms all being at the same level, different radius for each piece. Etch instead of paint areas. Layout like an actual chessboard so placement is obvious, extra queens on sideline? Etch the squares including the middle 4 rows, but squish them down or draw one of those lines indicating the middle portion has been excluded. Acrylic?

gluing and felting

This has become my main concern. Since there will be over 50g of lead in a pawn, I have slight worries on the longevity of it staying in place purely with CA glue. Not sure if lead and plastic are the best surfaces to glue together. I can do some tests to see if it might be a source of failure in the future and if so try some other options. Like enclosing the lead entirely in plastic, by printing each piece cut down the middle vertically. This will add an extra seam at best and make it looks pretty awful at worst.

Another option would borrow from drawer bottoms the slide into grooves. Then the felt can fit nicely into the space between the base and the bottom of the "drawer slide".

Another option could be instead of using CA glue, use casting resin...
Casting resin directly into the piece however might not work?
 If its just a cone shape it might not adhere to the plastic walls and only adhere to itself. Maybe make a sphere at the top of the cone so it cannot just fall out and the structure of the resin is stuck in the plastic?

 Video shows lead sinker being held into a wooden checker piece with resin: <https://youtu.be/FqEhmyAFI_8> 

<https://acrylgiessen.com/en/what-does-epoxy-not-stick-to/>

Print the piece upside down and pause right before sealing the bottom with plastic to insert the lead nugget. This would add supports for most pieces and risk falling over.

Print a stand for the chess pieces to hold them vertical while the epoxy cures in the base.
