Pieces counts in a chess set

| Piece   | Count | Height (mm) | Mass (g) | Base Diameter (mm) |
|---------|-------|-------------|----------|--------------------|
| King    | 2     |
| Queen   | 2     |
| Bisop   | 4     |
| Knight  | 4     |
| Rook    | 4     |
| Pawn    | 16    |

There are 14 pieces of Q,B,N,R. These are grouped since they have the same size hollow which simplifies the math.

- what is the weight added for each piece if perfectly fitted with lead?
- need to make the mould slightly larger than the desired yeilded metal object?
  - "make sure you account for any anticipated [shrinkage](https://youtu.be/GG2dF5PS0bI) when the metal cools" <https://www.thecrucible.org/guides/metalworking/metal-casting/>
- what's the cost there and compare with the coin method

volume cylinder: `pi *r^2* h`
volume of cone : `(1/3) *pi* r^2 *h`
dimensions of hollowed bottoms:
| Piece   | Radius (mm) | Depth (mm) | Sill (mm) | Area (cm^3) | Mass (g) | Cost ($) |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------|-------------|----------|----------|
| King    | 12.675      | 27.6       | 3.93      | 5.965       | 67.65    | 0.66     |
| Q,B,N,R | 12.87       | 15.35      | 3.86      | 4.002       | 45.38    | 0.44     |
| Pawn    | 9.60        | 12.4       | 3.91      | 1.951       | 22.13    | 0.22     |

lead needed: 1124.7 grams ~= 2.48 lbs ~= 43 oz
total cost: $11.00 of the actual used lead - this also includes the shipping costs. I'm not sure how much of the ingots will be wasted/scrap but I definitely don't expect to use the whole 5 pounds.

2267g ~= 5lb
cost per gram of lead: $0.00968 ~= $0.01 per gram

<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WQ6G6L> 5lb $22
<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001QV1BI2> 5lb $24
<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001QV3JBO> 5lb $26
<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001QV3DOM> 5lb $34
<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XD593NC> 10lb $36
<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GNWFX2O> 12.5lb $40
<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09GMWQ5CS> corn shaped ingots

<https://www.dailymetalprice.com/metalpricecharts.php?c=pb&u=lb&d=240>
cost ranges from 3.2 to 6.8 dollars per pound. I only need 2.5 pounds

Ended up buying 5 orders of "Lead Mini Ingot Pure 99.9% ~ 1 Pound-Mix sizes" from Roto Metals.
They had a sale going on for $2.59 per pound. After shipping and taxes it ended up being $21.94.
Just narrowly beating out Amazon's cheapest 5lb listing.

using coins as weights - "there's always money in the chess set!" arrested development reference :smile:

## Making Lead Weights

The melting point of [lead (Pb)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead) is `328 Â°C` which is relatively low for a metal.

Bought a [Lee Production Pot IV Electric Melter](https://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Do-it_Lead_Melting_Lee_Production_Pot_IV_/descpage-DILMPPIV.html) for $88 after taxes (which I pay) and shipping.
The alternative would have been to use a cast iron pot,
