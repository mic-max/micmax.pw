title: TBHAC Hotel Model
---

Recreate the model depicted on the [Arctic Monkeys album Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tranquility_Base_Hotel_%26_Casino) made of cardboard using plywood and a laser cutter. After searching online I saw many posts about recreating it. I wanted to go through the process myself.

I will use this project to gain experience on the laser cutter, most notably with layering and alligning accurately the cuts of plywood and reducing waste.

High resolution images of the album cover are available online however, [this video](https://youtu.be/6uGQ_ypTw08) showed the moving parts.

Attempt a 1:1 replica by referencing the [Revox A77 tape machine]() the hotel sat atop.
