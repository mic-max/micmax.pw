Buying the small ones, at least from Amazon, is not a very economical way of getting volume or amount of mints! Maybe I don't even bother with them, and just do another row of Large tins if needed.

## Design Planning

### Base

Due to the different heights of the tins a base to elevate and form fit to the bottom edge of the tins would be ideal.

Also, design the organizer to fit into my filing cabinet top or second drawer (I think they're the same dimensions). The design should keep the tins secure even if I remove some (up to a reasonable base minimum of both small and large tins). One idea to solve this would be to add a spring loaded mechanism to always clamp down, similar to shelves at grocery stores. Another (less automatic) option would be to cut spots for insertable walls. Heck, maybe even the base grooves alone are enough to keep those suckers in place.

13.29 large tins along width of the my filing cabinet drawer.

Fitting 13 would only leave `6mm` of wiggle room.

I have 3 large tins here and `64mm` is what they measure with a comfortable amount of wiggle room. So maybe `6mm` of bonus space is enough. But I might also have to account for wood or whatever I make the sides out of, if I make a design with sides, so that could eat into my real estate...

Since I already have 3 and I bought 12, I'll have at least 2 extra after a full row of tins. Don't worry I won't eat all these mints at once!

### Cleaning

Cleaning the tins. The only thing standing between the mints and their steel tin (haha) is a parchment paper which does nothing to stop mint dust from getting all over. I'll need to remove all the mints, put them in ziploc bags, and get washing!

#### Mint Extraditement


<!-- photos of mints in little baggies hehe. maybe also a pile of them on my desk looking like coke... -->

I was able to give little bags of Altoids to friends in a funny little way too. This saves me from ending up eating all `600 g` of mints. Curiously strong mints at that :detective:

### Dividers

Could 3D print some divider inserts for the tins to maximise used space. After a quick Google search this looks insanely popular.

> Reminding me of how with the truly incredible amount of people on Earth how rare it is for any idea to be unique or the first of its kind. Not that I believed an Altoids tin divider hadn't been done, I obviously did since I searched it :smile tongue:

Lots of the designs however print their own bottom and exterior walls which seems like a waste of space unless it is crucial for the structural rigidity which I don't think is the case (or should I say I don't think is the tin).

Before printing these since they do take a non-zero amount of time, I should group my things into... groups! To decide which Altoids tin they will rest in and so I know what kind of dividers to make or print.

- [Altoids Organizer: 4, 6, 8 Spaces](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1394943)
- [Altoids 3 Way Organiser - Minimalist](https://www.printables.com/model/301202-minimalist-3-way-altoids-organizer-for-t-nuts/files)
- [Altoids Split Horizontal](https://www.printables.com/model/194938-altoids-2-compartments-widthwise/files)

I'll print all three to get started, I imagine I would use one of each and also to verify the fit. If the fit is not satisfactory I might make some adjustments, but the photos look promising. When I wake in `5:42` all `50 g` of filament will be used to make perfect prints! :fingers_crossed:

Some electronic components would preferably get stored with their pins pushed into some nice cushy foam, like how they are usually shipped in. I would need to buy some of this after finding out what its called of the proper depth for my headers and cut to the shape of the tins base. 
<!-- probably should just leave these in and not glue them down -->

You know what, I have a bunch of this acoustic foam up on my walls. I could take some of that. It's kind of wavy though, if I could remove the waves it would be good and fit in the tin. Just tested a 7 segment display and the foam has a good hold onto its pins.

Storing batteries might be a problem since the steel is conductive. Some simple ways to stop the short circuit: tape, [Plasti Dip](https://www.instructables.com/Electrically-Insulated-Altoids-Tin/), plastic internal shell.

### Labeling

Large tins comfortably fit 9 characters from my Dymo on the side. Could add additional notes to other sides, but only one will be prominantly visible while stowed.

Small tins comfortably fit 5 characters from the Dymo on the short side.

Since they are only `95mm` I could also try stacking a second layer and remain under the `209mm` max drawer clearance with `19mm` to spare.

Thanks to Mark Simonelli for [this beautiful Altoid Tin](https://grabcad.com/library/altoid-tin) he shared on GrabCAD. Which I really didn't appreciate them forcing me to make an account and not being able to just use my Google account. Shame! I opened the STL file in my slicer and immediately noticed this model is not the proper scale. No worries though I can just scale up to the measurements that I took with my callipers.

I think the groove for the tins could be 3D printed simply by taking the tin model and performing a subtraction into a rectangular prism. They could be printed in ~4 tin sections and all screwed down to a base piece of plywood cut to fit snugly into the drawer.

Realising that the screws might interfere with the sliding in and out of the drawer as well as not having the correct drillbit I pivoted to using CA glue, which worked quite well and if I ever need to remove it I can spray some solvent and hopefully return the filling cabinet to its original [battle-scarred](https://totalcsgo.com/skin-conditions) glory.

## Post Script

I wish I had taken weight measurements on my spool when I had originally bought it. Then I could easily check how much filament is left so I don't accidentally start a `50g` print when the spool actually only has `40g` of filament on it.
