title: 3D Printing

## Introduction

For Christmas my Mom & Dad gifted me a 3D printer. On Black Friday I ordered the `Ender 5 Pro` with a spool of both black and white PLA filament. Sorry, but I can't contain my excitement until [Jesus' supposed Birthday](TODO) to use it :smiley:.

I've never used one before and the only experience I have 3D modelling was a couple days in grade 9 tech class in `AutoCAD` designing a rudimentary airplane. I'm excited for all the possibilities having a 3D printer will unlock. There are several 3D printers at Microsoft's Garage in Redmond that I could also be making use of...

## Why 3D Print Stuff

Once 3D printing becomes more accessible to the average person I can definitely see every household having one. I'm sure it has gotten loads easier in the past decade, but an easy mode and directory/catalog of parts to print or scanning something to duplicate with your phone would really elevate the accessibility. You can create so many things out of a common resource, being the plastic filament. It would also reduce the amount of shipping that occurs. Say you needed to buy a soap dish, a hair clip, and a tiny thingamajigger for your dishwasher that you can only get from this one store 40 minutes away and they are out of stock and it costs like $50. That sounds kinda lame. You would have to drive to 3 different stores or have them all delivered. I imagine that carbon footprint is pretty large for the comparatively small items you need. A more efficient way to get these items if you already had a 3D printer would be to download some 3D models, that hopefully already exist, and buy a multipurpose spool of plastic and run the printer overnight. The shipping cost then becomes more like a one-time fee for the spool and the prints are probably faster than someone driving it to your doorstep anyway.

In summary here's what I feel is good and what is bad about 3D printing

Pros:
- Customisable
- Smaller environmental impact due to less shipping
- Can be faster than buying from a store or online
- More convenient

Cons:
- Knowledge of 3D modelling
- Ease of use (calibrating perfect settings, needing a computer with specific software and an SD card to transfer the files)
- Removing the lattice structures
- Small size items only
- Smaller scale operations, injection molding plastic is much more efficient at high scale


## Unboxing + Building

First of all I need to unbox and build the printer.

## First Print

Now that the construction part is complete, I'll run a test print of something fun!

## Soap Dish

I have a noted down a few ideas for things to print already, one of those is a soap dish. I am sick and tired of my soap becoming a mushy blob after sitting on the side of my bath. I found this model <TODO>.

## Conclusion

I will definitely have a mindset of can I build this myself now whenever I have the desire to buy something. Not only would it be more fun to do, it could also be more convenient depending on the circumstances and also self-sufficient. If you want something done right, do it yourself :joy:
