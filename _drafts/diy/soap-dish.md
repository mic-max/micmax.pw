title: 3D Printing - Ender 5 Pro
---

## Introduction

For Christmas my Mom & Dad gifted me a 3D printer. On Black Friday I ordered the `Ender 5 Pro` with a 1 KG spools of both black and white PLA filament. Sorry, but I can't contain my excitement until [Jesus' supposed Birthday](https://www.ucg.org/the-good-news/biblical-evidence-shows-jesus-christ-wasnt-born-on-dec-25) to use it :smiley:

I've never used one before and the only experience I have 3D modelling was a couple days in grade 9 tech class using `AutoCAD` to design a rudimentary airplane. I'm excited for all the possibilities having a 3D printer will unlock. There are several 3D printers at the Microsoft Garage in Redmond that I could also be making use of...

## Why 3D Print Stuff

Once 3D printing becomes more accessible to the average person I can definitely see every household having one. I'm sure it has gotten loads easier in the past decade, but an easy mode and directory/catalog of parts to print or scanning something to duplicate with your phone would really elevate the accessibility. You can create so many things out of a common resource, being the plastic filament. It would also reduce the amount of shipping that occurs. Say you needed to buy a soap dish, a hair clip, and a tiny thingamajigger for your dishwasher that you can only get from this one store 40 minutes away and they are out of stock and it costs like $50. That sounds kinda lame. You would have to drive to 3 different stores or have them all delivered. I imagine that carbon footprint is pretty large for the comparatively small items you need. A more efficient way to get these items if you already had a 3D printer would be to download some 3D models, that hopefully already exist, and buy a multipurpose spool of plastic and run the printer overnight. The shipping cost then becomes more like a one-time fee for the spool and the prints are probably faster than someone driving it to your doorstep anyway.

In summary here's what I feel is good and what is bad about 3D printing

Pros:

- Customisable
- Smaller environmental impact due to less shipping
- Can be faster than buying from a store or online
- More convenient

Cons:

- Knowledge of 3D modelling
- Ease of use (calibrating perfect settings, needing a computer with specific software and an SD card to transfer the files)
- Removing the lattice structures
- Small size items only
- Smaller scale operations, injection molding plastic is much more efficient at high scale

## Unboxing + Building + Setup

First of all I need to unbox and build the printer. This ended up being much easier than I anticipated. As much of the printer was already pre-assembled as possible and only required me to screw in the base to the top, add the print bed, control unit with screen, and connect all the cables. The cables were pretty well labeled, but I still managed to mix up the print head thermistor with the print bed thermistor :joy:. The packaging was also superb and included a 200g spool of PLA to get going.

## First Print

Now that the construction part is complete, I'll run a test print!
Since this is the first print, I must calibrate the print head to be only slightly above the print bed in its home position. Once done that I set the temperature to 200 degrees farenheit?? and guide the filament to the head until some begins to extrude.
The printer came with a micro SD card and a USB adapter for it. The files included on it were the Creality Slicer application, several STL files and some already pre-sliced files.
I decided to go with the 10x10 maze since it only takes an hour to complete and uses minimal filament, since my goal was just to see if the thing worked.
After slicing and exporting the file to the micro SD card, I plugged it into the Ender 5 Pro and selected from the menu to load 1 

## Soap Dish

I have a noted down a few ideas for things to print already, one of those is a soap dish. I am sick and tired of my soap becoming a mushy blob after sitting on the side of my bath. I found this model <TODO>.

## Conclusion

I will definitely have a mindset of can I build this myself now whenever I have the desire to buy something. Not only would it be more fun to do, it could also be more convenient depending on the circumstances and also self-sufficient. If you want something done right, do it yourself :joy:
