Do combined ones for the engaged and married?

## Preparation

1. Get a list of people to invite
1. Pick a date (early to mid Jan 2023)
1. Have them RSVP
   1. Full name to display
   1. Birth date + time + location

## Construction

I'd like it to be somewhere in the range of 9" to 12" diameter. It would also need to be thick enough for a nail to be partially driven in so 1" to 1.5" thick. Given those dimensions if I get a 10" diameter log that is 48" long that would be perfect! As long as I am able to cut slices off like a deli working some bolgna.

Optionally I could make some small wooden stands for people who don't want to wall mount. But all will include a wall mount hole for simplicity.

Where should the name, birthday and location be etched?

Instead of etching some parts onto the tree ring, cut them out and inlay a nicer piece of etched hardwood? Wood make the etching a lot cleaner and allow for more customisation like using a different type of wood for special signs: sun, moon, etc. Another point of contrast could be that the tree rings are end grain, but the inserts are [face grain or edge grain](https://www.laurelmercantile.com/blogs/journal/end-grains-edge-grains-and).

Thinking about the prospect of making multiple copies of a similar item but it be customisable also gives me ideas about making these online for sale.

Common could be 1 layer in Inkscape and all user specifics another layer to ensure they all line up properly.

1. Tree ring

   1. Etch common base file
   1. Etch user specific file
   1. Remove masking tape
1. Sand
1. Stain

## Materials

- Wood
- Masking Tape
- Nails / Screws
- Thread / Yarn
- Stain (24+ hours to dry)
- Paint (maybe Kari has)

## Cost

This might end up being somwhat costly but if I average it out among everyone just for the materials that should be good. I'd only do this if the cost is excessive. It also depends on the amount of people who RSVP. [Economies of scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale)!

## Design

Make base design, then a separate design for each participant including only their specifics.

- SVG library that includes all signs
- Curve text around a circle
