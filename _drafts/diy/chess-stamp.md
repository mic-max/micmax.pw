title: Chess Stamp
---

A stamp that has the ability to represent any chess position.
An 8x8 grid that you can slot mini pieces stamps into rails or something.
Probably want the size to be about 3" x 3" or so.
High enough resolution to distinguish the pieces but also not so large that only a few could fit on a normal sheet of paper.
Picking the images for the 6 pieces is likely very key.
