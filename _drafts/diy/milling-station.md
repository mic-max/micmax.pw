I was originally going to follow the plan shown in [this video](https://youtu.be/7ks0xqr1TOg) but then I saw [the all in one jointer & planer stand with dust collection by One Minute Workbench](https://youtu.be/zsB9iXAQ7As) and was very impressed. He had really thought of everything when designing and building this awesome cabinet!

I had literally just ordered the pocket hole jig and other related tools to do it The Trull Gallery way and thankfully Amazon is very relaxed about cancelling orders! My business account transactions will only be slightly messier.

## Post Script

Words I wrote before I decided against using pocket holes.

Pocket holes are not the most beautiful joinery option. However, the gaping hole they create can be plugged! Thanks to [this genius](https://youtu.be/GvJbpU3NSwU) for showing me how to make my own plugs! Not gonna lie I didn't see the vision at first. I don't have a band saw though so I xxx (clamped jig saw to table, flush trim saw?) I could design a 3D printed version of this jig too.
