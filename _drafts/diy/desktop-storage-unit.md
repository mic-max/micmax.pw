title: Desk Storage Unit
---

- Built-in speaker stands on the sides, vibration dampening pads on bottom?
  - Instead of angling them upwards, I could make them taller
  - Headphone hook on the side. Something to wrap the cable up with or onto
  - AUX Cable that leads out back to connect to my record player or phone
  - Headphone cable clean routing
- Storage for keyboard and mouse
- USB Hub
- CD Drive
- Floppy Drive
- Lighting strip
- Fit under LG Dual up monitor (15.5cm height), shorter is better
- Wallet + keys, hook on the side.
- SDAC
- GameCube Adapter
  - Making the cable exit the rear might simplify things
  - A design that optimizes height and cares less about depth could also be cleaner
- Cable managed
- Easily movable if I want to clean my desk for example
- Clampable into place so it doesn't move from the back
- Cutout for Camera mount or monitor mount if needed
- Coaster storage
- iPhone and iPad storage / charging
  - Magsafe charger?!
- Mac mini
- Look aesthetic from all angles
- Calculator
- Callipers
- Dongle storage: dead plug for these small dongles for storage but aren't plugged into anything. 3D print some female and male mounting points. USB Type-A, Lightning, AUX, USB Type-C, etc.
- Altoids Slot
- Blistex Slot
- Lighter Slot
- Candle Slot, specifically P.F. Candles?
- Receipt Printer? Could be an attachment, similar to how breadboards can be connected.


Route small grooves in the base so the items have a secure place to live. Like a `3mm` deep groove for the mouse, keyboard contact pads, etc.

Make things easy to remove without my fingers getting in the way. Add a ribbon behind them to pull and it comes out (similar idea to the middle compartment of my wallet).
