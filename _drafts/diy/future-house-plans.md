---

- all countertops to my height
- speakers in every room
- easy to clean, not many places for dust to accumulate on a surface

bathroom

- bidet
- window
- shower floor gritty texture
- high water pressure
- shower nozzle above my head
- sink
  - hands don't hit back wall when washing
  - flush with the countertop
- electric toothbrush charging cable free, razor too
- soap and shampoo dispensers built into shower
- toothpaste dispenser (and for other commonly used liquids)
- place to sit in the shower
- long oval toilet seat/bowl
- soft close lid
- mirror with good lighting built in, can see my whole face in it standing up straight
- humidity sensing fan - only stays on after shower until moisture is gone
- put shower handle on wall opposite to head, so you can turn on without getting wet
- heat lamp
- hot air vent that I can stand under when it's cold to dry off

outdoor courtyard in the middle of the house
stone

bar

- keg fridge
- red solo cup dispenser?
- beer pong setup

kitchen

- island (for beer pong)
- dishwasher close to plates, cutlery and glasses cupboards

utilities

- fast internet, wifi and Ethernet in every room

exterior

- black window frames (brownstones in DC with black door and windows looked amazing)

one tap for both hot and cold - calibrate so that a max comfortable hot temperature can easily be set
tile the whole bathroom so no water can damage or get on floor
try to avoid water splashing onto counter while tap is running, maybe have water come from opposite side of sink so the splash goes away from the person
face washing area that doesn't kill my back, spit sink?
toothpaste and soap dispenser
soap and shampoo, body wash, face wash, built into shower
window in shower with a view
good showerhead above my head height
temperature control same with sink in shower
have the supplies of shampoo and soap stuff be coming from a large reservoir that only needs to be filled very rarely? this might just overcomplicate things though..
speakers built into the bathroom with Alexa and Spotify
touch controls in the shower
bidet toilet
mirror with lights built in
rgb led smart lights everywhere
towel rack with ability to dry then faster
place for electric toothbrushes
dispenser for face products, cotton pads and qtips
no shower curtain, glass or nothing at all
minimize the things that dust can collect on like baseboards and outlets/switches


Christmas lights preinstalled, rgb and programmable

server room with all my computers in it, that I just run peripheral docks to my desk

dirty laundry shoot from rooms to laundry room, blacks and lights

entry using fingerprint or facial recognition or number combo, no need to have a bunch of keys

laundry machine



kitchen drawers with foam cutouts for the utensils so they don't move around at all
soft close drawers and cabinets

fridge with ice and water purified
Bottom freezer
gas stove
