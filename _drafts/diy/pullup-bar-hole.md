title: Fixing Chinup Bar Holes
---

Old apartment building
Stick I found on an outing one day (find the day?)
I will cut to length and widdle to diameter of hole
Glue in with sawdust and woodglue
and saw off excess and sand
I could stain but I think the contrast would look better and be more obvious that a modification was done here so future people know about it. not trying to conceal anything here to avoid losing some of my security deposit for example.
