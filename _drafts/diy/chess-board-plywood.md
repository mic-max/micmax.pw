title: Plywood Chess Board
---

I'm going on a weeklong plus ski trip with friends and chess shall be played. I've been unable to build a proper hardwood chess board since my woodworking class was cancelled. I whipped this functional but not beautiful checker pattern board up a few days to the best of my ability :wood:

## Tools

- Oil brush $11.97
- Measuring tape
- [3" Masking Tape](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DVAYT4E)
- Sandpaper in 60, 100, 150, 220 grits
- Pencil
- Straight edge
- Handsaw
- X-Acto knife with ancient blades

## Materials

- 11/32" Plywood [18" x 18"] - $42 total equating to $2.95 used
- Sealant clear protective sealant, polyuerethane
- Dark wood **gel** stain

Bill of materials: $5

## Plan

2" squares on an 18" board giving a 1" padding around outside.
I originally cut the 18" square from my plywood planning on making an [official 2.25" sized square board]() but saw that a border would look better and my pieces still had plenty of breathing room on 2" squares.

## Build

Using only a handsaw so the edges are very rough.

Don't want to risk cutting down the middle and adding hinges so it could be folded since my precision with a handsaw is subpar.

Sanded all the sides with progressively less rough sandpaper: 60 grit, 100 grit and finally 150 grit.

### Masking

Covered the entire board with some masking tape which hopefully it doesn't let the stain through!

My [measuring tape has a little wiggle](https://www.thisoldhouse.com/tools/21015038/what-makes-it-wiggle) to it!

### Staining

Grain runs with the ranks. Seems better than the files in my mind because it makes forward progress feel more difficult into enemy territory and can be visualised as trenches for chess players that have not been sapped of all imagination.

Masking tape was likely left on too long, it left residue when peeling off after staining. Which was left to dry for about 16 hours. Sanding afterwards would have negatively impacted the stained squares so I just went straight on with the clear coat.

I did 1 coat, waited four hours as the can directed me to (I listen to cans) and applied another. Only going with 2 instead of 3 so it has more time to dry before being used as a playing surface.

???Sanding the clearcoat with 220 grit?

Rank and file symbols with Dymo or black paint? wood burner?
sign it with wood burner, micmax logo and date.

It's not the prettiest thing in the world but then again neither am I. And I love myself.
