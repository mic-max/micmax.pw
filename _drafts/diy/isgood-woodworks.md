title: IsGood Woodworks - Small Projects Class
---

I signed up for the [Small Projects Class](https://isgoodbilling.com/product/small-projects/) Jan 17 to Feb 21 2022. That's 6x 3-hour sessions where I expect to

> Build a tool tote, cutting boards, and a trick band saw tray. After we have all made one of each in a teamwork style, students will continue with their choice of additional variations on the above until the class ends, working independently or in small teams. At the end of the class you will have shop certification for unsupervised use of table saws, jointers, planers, wide belt sanders, band saws, disk sanders, oscillating spindle sanders, flap sanders, and many hand held power tools.

This is a small class 3-7 beginner level students costing $535 including material.
