keeping them vertical is the best practice to avoid the record from becoming warped
bought 1" screws, needed 2"
$50 or less from Home Depot. thanks Yushi and Tristan for accompanying me and then hitting the BK from a quick bite afterwards.

keep my vinyls in a plastic sleeve and have replaced all the inner sleeves with ones i bought. so now I have a pile of the original sleeves and some little artwork included and some of them also came with some digital download codes.
