title: Velcro Hat
---

I saw a hat that had a velcro'd on design when I was browsing at North [35th North Skateshop](https://35thnorth.com/). It was the [Fucking Awesome Velcro Volley Strap-Back](https://35thnorth.com/collections/headwear/products/fucking-awesome-velcro-volley-strap-back-white-1) and I thought it was a really sweet idea - one hat, unlimited possibilities. So let's get crafting!

I'm not sure if `Fucking Awesome` sells different style velcro pieces you can swap out or not. They should! One drawback is that the size and shape of the velcro pieces that is sewn to the hat is not changeable. So if you wanted just a small design, you would be able to see the soft black velcro behind it an sticking out on the edges. Maybe we can get around that by using a few smaller circular velcro mounting points, then if you want a small design just use smaller patches and even it would look decent with them being empty.
