title: Homemade Cornhole
---

My friend is hosting a cornhole tournament on Sunday. In the group chat today he asked what the odds were I could provide a second cornhole set. Say less King, I work well with tight deadlines. There's no time to lose to let's get cooking! :corn:

## Cornhole

So it's a "sport" where you throw beanbags onto a board that has a hole cut in it. You score points by getting a bag on the board or through its gaping hole. Usually drinking is involved.

There is an official league, go figure. I will be following [their official rules](https://www.playcornhole.org/pages/rules) or ignoring them as I see fit.

I made the following video of the building and painting process.

## Board

I will go pickup a sheet of `5.2 mm` Birch plywood from The WoodSource nearby and have them cut it into 4 equal 48" x 24" (i will lose some size on the small dimesion due to kerf) to make the faces. This will be enough for 2 sets of cornhole boards. Technically they want `12 mm` but that's double the price and [Specific Love Creations](https://youtu.be/aOg5mBknbNQ) had no issue using `3.2 mm`.

The legs should fold back into the board for easy storage.

I'm planning on using `18 GA` brad nails to secure everything. These will hopefully have no impact on the cornbags sliding on the face.
Countersink and hide screws with wood putty.

27' and 21' string for easy setup without a tape measure.

### Handles

These would make carrying them much easier.

Also adding latches to they can be carried as a single unit instead of taking up two hands.

They weigh TODO pounds.

### Beverage Holders

Cut from legs.

### Scoring

To help the drunk sportsmen and sportswomen keep track of the scores I will be printing and screwing onto the backside of the boards some of [these](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4826140). I might make a modification to the `11` and `21` score markers to try out my PaintStik's.

This is actually the only thing I could get started on tonight (Friday). So I kicked off a print for 41 rings (`37 g` : `1hr 28m`) and 4 holders (`42 g`: `1h 7m`) in white, and then the same in matte blue. I also used this opportunity to try to make timelapses, it will be a learning experience for sure... :joy:

I will need to get some `9 mm` dowel from The Home Depot tomorrow.

I am especially happy that the rings being printed did not trigger any Trypophobia deep in primal trauma centres :phew:

### Painting

Luckily my Dad had all the spraypaint colours I wanted in the basement. Those being: blue, white, and black. I already knew he had white because the other day I was put in charge of painting the [pitcher's boxes](#TODO).

I'm thinking of just stealing [this basic triangle design](https://www.ana-white.com/woodworking-projects/easiest-corn-hole-board-plans-free-printable-pdf). I liked how the triangle went from the top to the sides, felt like a good use of real estate for the design. I also liked the feature of adding a couple centimeter outline to the hole and also painting the inside edges of the cut circle. I will do that in black. The front triangle in white, leave a band to show the natural birch wood, and the back in blue.

Mask it off with tape and garbage bags and get spraying!

The Internet says paint takes less than 24 hours to dry, so let's hope that's true!

## Result

Here is the final result! Something that before a few days ago wasn't even an idea in my head to existing in the physical realm. Pretty cool how with a bit of energy we can rearrange matter into new structures.

## Timelapse Learnings

- The enclosure's transparent plastic is too shiny. Opening it makes my room smell like melting plastic though...
- My (Mom's) tripod doesn't go low enough with my printer on the floor to get a good front angle when the print bed is near its maximum height (first several layers)
- These flood lights get really hot and my camera being in front of them will fry it
- My camera's built in timelapse function (TODO on my opinions)
- Autofocus, might focus on my printer's LCD
- Make sure the number of photos * the interval between photos is greater than time to print or you will miss the end!
- Extruder is jumps around to different locations each shot is sometimes distracting. I think it works well if the extruder is covering a large surface area per layer.
  - Make the video only from images where the extruder is around a certain location
- Printer shakes probably add a hardly noticeable wobble to the timelapse because the extruder is moving around so fast during the photo
- Extruder casts a shadow, need more lights or line up camera with the light
- Interval 5s vs 10s
- Speedup printer startup since I have to either wait for it to finish before starting timelapse or account for prep time and use extra SD card space
- Do not need to capture both RAW and JPEG formats

## Redacted Jokes

- Country girls make do
- Corn usually comes outta my hole intact
- Using metric values :sad: Sorry! Eh!

## Tournament Results

Well played everyone, it was a very fun filled day! My team with Juli: The Catatonics, finished in second place bested by the folks over at Corner Gas!

Only slightly annoyed that we didn't use the board I spent basically the entire day before building with essentially no notice in any of the official games :sad:
