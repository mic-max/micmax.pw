title: Pottery Stamp
---

So my friend @yelli_r 's pottery teacher wanted to sign her pottery with a stamp instead of by hand each time.

So I have the task of designing and printing a 3D stamp meant for clay in exchange for a cool mug!

This reminds me of (one of) the first time(s) I earned money from programming back in the summer of spring of 2015 someone I was going to be classmates with at University I met online was building a site for a client in PHP and I helped provide the email form code and he e-transfered me $20 CAD for my time. I was officially a professional programmer!
