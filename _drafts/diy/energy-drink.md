title: Homemade Energy Drink
---

Monster, Red Bull, Rockstar, these are some of the brands that have an iron grip on my wallet. I like to drink a caffeinated beverage in the morning to get going most days, espescially before work. I shall now attempt to concoct my own cheaper and healthier alternative formula.

## Plan

I will dissolve caffeine into water at about `150mg per 500ml` which is the same as most larger can energy drinks. I may need to heat up the water to achieve a good dissolve, not sure. Then I will add some flavour using some water flavour enhancer such as [MiO](https://www.makeitmio.com/). Finally, I will carbonate it and store them in bottles in my fridge.

## Cost

Buying a `24 pack of Monster Zero Sugar` from Amazon cost `$37.46` total and was delivered in 2-3 days. The Seattle lawmakers came up with this asinine [Sweetened Beverage Tax](https://www.seattle.gov/license-and-tax-administration/business-license-tax/other-seattle-taxes/sweetened-beverage-tax) in January 2018.

Do they tax coffee with sugar? What about if the sugar is on the side and the customer adds it, then they can dodge the tax right? Is raw sugar taxed? What's stopping me from buying raw sugar and mixing it with all my beverages? Nothing, just the inconvenience eh? Fuck you goverment.

Shortly after this tax, the [Capitol Hill Mystery Soda Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill%27s_mystery_soda_machine) disappeared... coincidence I think not. I never even got to see it :sad:

G-Fuel is another energy drink I _use_. It comes in a tub of powder you mix with water. It costs `$TODO per 40 servings`. I have two shaker cups so at the end of each day I could [replenish](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ksjiyv/in_this_house_we_replinish/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) the fridge with fuel.

## Safety Precautions

Caffeine can be overdosed on. This is one of the side-effects I would like to avoid...
