## Wall Attachment

command strip
adhesive tape 3m pre-applied one side
screws
nails
2 so they dont become unlevel like a picture frame
include alcohol wipes used to clean the wall surface (I will clean with alcohol too before attaching the adhesive part to the wood)

ensure they are level and spaced evenly with their neighbour
include some construction paper cut to the size of an album?
or a cutout from the box.

## Construction

solid wood

stain before split cut? then hit extra edges afterward.
they will be made from a large strip of wood and then cut to their width. so if it is 4 inches long and the stock wood is 72".
all grooves or whatever will be cut into the large piece together. then cut into 18 separate pieces. which will have some extra finishing to be done likely

shouldn't take long to make. no glue involved.

it will likely be an L shape. which means there might be lots of wood waste? try to minimize it but might just be a reality with it being a solid piece of wood.

## Economics

offer several types of wood. exotic is possible since amount of wood used per is quite small.
1x3 x 10' of bloodwood is $57.50 which would be about 30 units. about $2 each.
make a batch of a few different species. maple, walnut, cherry, purpleheart?
offer all types of wood available at woodsource/kjp but mark them as backorder/longer shipping times. and require an order of at least X for these woods.

give discounts if buying more? 10+, 20+, 40+ etc.

make all even if there is a knot or something and sell at a discount. not much more time consuming and better than scraping it.

## Competition

plastic
wood
metal?

barnwood is $38
Maybe a slight roundover.

## Distribution

good because the weight is low. small box. easier shipping. easier to sell than a $600 table.
