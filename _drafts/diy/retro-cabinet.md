## Construction

Match colour of apartment?

- 1/2" Plywood 4' x 8'
  - Walnut 19mm $167
  - Cherry 19mm $150
  - Maple 12mm $80. 19mm $116
  - Baltic Birch 12mm $100. 15mm $140. 19mm $140.
  - 45" x 48" remaining for shelves.
  - 6x 16" x 16.75". Might just be enough. 48"/16" = 3. Might need to shrink this dimension (depth) otherwise we need 2x sheets...
  - Maybe 15" x 15" x 48"? 
- Edge Tape ~$20 for 50'
  - Would need the Stanley trimming tool
- Dowel Joinery
- Drawer Slides and Handle
- Wheels (4x in my closet)
- Drawer pull (3d print?)

Mitre corners to hide plywood edges. Hard to glue up...
Pocket holes for drawer
Hole in backside for power cable

## Concerns

- Speaker [vibrations](https://www.discogs.com/digs/gear/turntable-isolation-how-to-fix-vibration/) affecting record playback
- related to the `now spinning shelf` project
- TV height is comfortable for playing video games in the classic hunched over gamer stance
- How much will everything weight (40 records: 25lbs, tv: , typewriter: , paper: , speakers: , record player: , battery: )
