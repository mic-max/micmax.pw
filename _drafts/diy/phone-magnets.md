title: Phone Magnets
---

On the back of my phone I have a ring holder, it helps me hang onto my phone since without a case it's quite sliperry.
Anyway, this has a big piece of metal in it that I currently only use to mount my phone when I'm in my car.
I bought some magnets and will be outfitting my apartment with phone mounting positions :mountain:

I plan on at least adding one to my desk area, my bed frame so I watch videos in bed hands free on my phone, and maybe in the kitchen somewhere.
