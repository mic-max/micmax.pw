[Measure Kerf](https://youtu.be/N_BAjy4R8lg)
Simply make a cut not completely through and measure the size of the gap left by the blade using kalipers.

![Blueprint for board cuts](/assets/img/chess-board/blueprint.png)

TODO: the 7 cuts on the glued together boards will also reduce the square size by 7 * .125".

grain in direction of ranksuse sawdust to pack cracks and sand downclamp vertically too while horizontally glueing to prevent it from crowningrouter the edges, cut into the squares at the middle, and cut top and bottom of into.where can i leave the boards to dry? table space.

Etch the A-H ranks and 1-8 files with the laser cutter? Initial alignment would be crucial.

Step 1 create 4 light and dark strips of wood. square size * height * (8 * square size) in dimension.


## Result

TODO

## Future Ideas

- Make a chess set with ability to do something cool.
- Track games - using NFC tags on each square and piece?
- Make a chess set that is hard to knock over. The pieces could lock in kinda like a key in a lock.
- Build a timer into the board.

## Improve Efficiency

sizing wood
===========
joint 5" wide x [1" - 2"] boards
 - optimal width would be a multiple of the square size, + 1/8" * (multiple - 1) ::: anything extra will surely be waste
plane boards to uniform thickness
rip boards to [1.75" - 2.25"]

skip step
========
mitre strips to [16" - 20"] lengths

clamp together the [14" - 18"] by whatever length of boards were used
(there must be a limit on what still makes sense, economically when buying the wood and feasibility with my current tools)

crosscut the glued up strips the other direction
================================================
- crosscut sled
- radial arm saw <https://www.dewalt.co.uk/product/dw721kn-qs/300mm-radial-arm-saw?tid=573781>

border...

glue and clamping each board

+ more clamps
- clamping rigs (flat and square)
- glue silicone brush
- glue table
- glue must cure at room temperature
- best glue removal process (scrape after vs. wet rag before it dries)

adding magnets

sanding
=======

finishing
=========
+ have them sit in a way that the stain can dry both sides at once
- rockler bench cookie w/ finishing cone.
