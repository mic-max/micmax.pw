Simply make a cut not completely through and measure the size of the gap left by the blade using kalipers.

TODO: the 7 cuts on the glued together boards will also reduce the square size by 7 * .125".

## Future Ideas

- Make a chess set with ability to do something cool.
- Track games - using NFC tags on each square and piece?
- Make a chess set that is hard to knock over. The pieces could lock in kinda like a key in a lock.
- Build a timer into the board.
