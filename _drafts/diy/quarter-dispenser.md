When I do laundy I have a jar of quarters I take from.
It'd be a little more convenient if it would auto drop me either 4 or 8 quarters for a wash and a wash + dry respectively.

could 3d print something. also place to store my dryer sheets?

organise them into sections by year using computer vision
