title: Backgammon Board
---

Popular piece size: 35mm x 10.5mm or 40mm x 12mm
 Diameter to thickness ratio from this set <https://buywegames.com/products/we-games-mother-of-pearl-acrylic-backgammon-checkers-chips-in-red-cream-1-inch-diameter>
 This means I could likely get a 4.91 cm^3 or 8.14 cm^3 of lead using 2mm thick walls. Which would be ~50g and 88g!
 Add a few varying diameter and depth cylinders to the aluminum mold. D: 31mm, 33mm, 35mm. H: 6.5mm, 7.5mm, ? Couldn't I just try to pour a different depth in the same hole? If I make it too big or small just remelt it?
Triangle dimensions: chip diameter by 5x chip diameter?
6 triangle groups, making 24 total triangles
Frame height and thickness
Joinery for corners? Mitre (w/ spline)
My parents board is about 12.5 chips in interior length. Need to check the width...
  do you want it to be able to be a square?

Doesn't necessarily have to be folding. It makes for easy storage and the pieces are easily stored in the game

21" tournament sized boards
Leather is preferred since it deafens dice sounds and provides the chips more friction

Solid wood

What do I make the bottom out of? Or is the backgammon triangles the bottom

At least 3 species: 2 coloured triangles

15x chips for each team (weighted, wood or plastic) + storage
2x dice for each team + storage
1x different and bigger dice
Dice shaker cup + storage?
Chip slots at base of triangles
Closing: hinges, magnets: cost and feel

When the box is closed have the grain line up?
 Make the pieces twice as tall as needed, then rip down middle on table saw and drum sand to equal thickness.

Laser cutter with veneers less than 0.8mm thick

So that the veneers don't make the surface uneven pour a thin layer of clear epoxy?

Can it also be a chess board?

This video taught me how I could make the cuts and assemble it easily. Making a bunch of triangles. 12 in wood 1, 12 in wood 2 and 24 in wood 3. Then some extra wood 3 would be needed for the middle of the board creating a gap between the triangle tips. That's one way I could do it anyways.
