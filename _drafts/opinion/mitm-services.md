Uber, grubhub, airbnb, ticketmaster, cameo.
Their fees are crazy, the implementation should be easy enough. Like craigslist and facebook marketplace are free places to sell physical things.

guess how much it would cost to run uber servers for example in a location.

## Driving Humans vs. Delivering Food

uber eats and uber jobs are 95% the same thing, being told where to drive. with the exception of picking up food that can't move so you have to go into the restaurant and get it and drop it off at the hungry person's door.

food smells good, some people dont.
finding the restaurant is probably easier on average than finding a person, especially if they're intoxicated.
the food could spill in your car, but digested food could spill out of the passenger into your car
they're probably equally not ready to get picked up. dropping off is instantaneous though.
if a person cancels an uber you kick them out on the highway and could feel guilt if they got hit by another car at 60mph, but if an eats order is cancelled you probably get to eat their food right?
