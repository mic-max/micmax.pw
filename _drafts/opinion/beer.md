title: Beer Tier List
---

After years of drinking beer I finally wanted to figure out which ones I liked and disliked. I feel a side-by-side comparison is the best way to really know, even though I may be getting more relaxed with my rankings as I finished more beers.

I wanted to cover most of the beers I'd buy, that were widely available so I made a trip to QFC and the local corner store for some fine brews. On June 26, 2021 I invited some thirsty friends over to tackle this array of `15` types of beer. Before getting into the rankings I will admit I have an aversion to stouts and very hoppy beers (not that any here were).

The beers were sipped knowing full well which brand was in your cup. Therefore, some slight preconceived beer-bias may have been in effect or affect... I guess I'll have to do another one :wink:

_`S` is the best, each category in order of how much I like. i.e. `Sapporo > Dos Equis`_
