title: Why One Computer Is all you need
---

With traveling and laptops becoming more powerful I've been thinking about the one computer benefits. I only had one computer until I went to university. Before then it was just a desktop but then I need a laptop to be able to take to class. And yes I do like to take notes still with paper but you can understand a computer science degree would be easier with a laptop.

So at first having one computer meant all my accounts were logged in, all applications and files were in their rightful place, and all was well. With the introduction of my laptop, now I have to sync everything. Oh I thought was logged into Netflix... what was that password again? Let me email this file to myself so I can get it on my other PC or transfer to a USB stick. I guess I have to install that application I already have on my desktop. This would be faster on my desktop. When you leave somewhere and were in the middle of something that you want to work on at the next location, you will have to migrate it from your desktop. The list of these minor inconveniences of having two computers is plentiful.

Something like a cloud operating system idea sounds cool. Just boot up the computer sign into your account from any computer in the world and everything you have is there. Obviously sharing all your files with some company might not sound good, but the notion of everything being contained does. 

So, what can I do in the meantime to rid myself of these multi PC problems. First off, I could sell all my computers and buy a powerful laptop. I would like it to be close to the power of a desktop, so video editing and gaming are not impacted. It should have lots of storage. I would need a docking station to plugin to at my locations, right now that is my apartment and my parents home. Carrying around just the laptop and charger is ideal. Carrying the mouse, keyboard, etc. is a pain.

I have went back to the one PC land in the past. When I moved to Seattle I basically only took clothing. So I bought a Razer Blade 14 gaming laptop. It got pretty hot and wasn't able to keep up with new games like Red Dead Redemption 2 at the time.

Having enough storage on the device for everything means that I won't need to host a local Plex server to cast from one PC to another. I would do this by hooking my laptop to my TV's HDMI and connecting to my desktops plex server. Skip the whole plex server and just plug in the HDMI. Plex server would still be useful if I ever want to cast to an iPad or phone, but why would I do that if I have my laptop screen accessible to me, or better yet an HD TV!

A major downside of this method is the upgradability and wear. A desktop from 2015 can be upgraded with a stick of RAM and GPU to keep up with the modern ones at a fraction of the cost of a new laptop. There is much less ways for a desktop to be broken, first off because it is stationary for the majority of its life, not being banged around in backpacks, pushed on its built-in keyboard amd dropped accidentally! A lot of a laptops accessories can be hard to fix and if broken that almost means you need a brand new one. Keyboard, trackpad, microphone, speakers, display, battery: these are all things that are not built into desktop computers.

Downside: Having multiple could be good for splitting work up. Say I have a gaming PC, one for writing code, and one for editing. I don't have to install any gaming stuff on the other and won't be tempted to game while writing as easily. I also won't have to close any applications or browsers so that I can reduce resource usage on background programs.
