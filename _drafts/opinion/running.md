2023 km in the year 2023.
Works out to just under [a marathon](https://www.google.com/search?q=marathon+origin&sxsrf=AJOqlzUR5Rc-13l797hbU3kch85IpdarHw%3A1677022532572&ei=RFX1Y9TOIpHM9APM74zACw&ved=0ahUKEwjUgNbi46f9AhURJn0KHcw3A7gQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=marathon+origin&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIKCAAQgAQQFBCHAjIKCAAQgAQQFBCHAjIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUILhCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEOgoIABBHENYEELADOgcIABCwAxBDOgUIABCRAjoLCAAQgAQQsQMQgwE6EQguEIMBEMcBELEDENEDEIAEOgsILhCABBDHARCvAUoECEEYAFDiB1iWDGC8EGgBcAF4AIABa4gBlwSSAQM0LjKYAQCgAQHIAQrAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) of distance per week. 38.9 Km instead of the 42.1 Km.

My friend Kip asked what else I've written about and mentioned running which at first I had been like oh ya that would be a boring read. But I do have thoughts about running that might interest others and getting them down in writing to share with other runners could be cool. I only have a few friends who are regular runners and I prefer doing it alone so I rarely get the opportunity to talk about it.

It is very human to run.

Shoe width.
Nipple lube
Sweatband or hat
Foot glide
Electrolyte pucks, 300mg sodium

Salt accumulating in your eye corners

Drinking water mid run

Gatorade after, sometimes two.

Stretching

Renaud's

Appears in my hands after 15km+ runs like 15 minutes after I get home.

Mentality

- Counting steps
- Treating the plateau at the top of the hills as a rest from the incline instead of fully stopping
- Running past others and being passed
- People in cars or walking that might make you feel self conscious, more common if you are a beginner

People blocking sidewalk, and people stepping aside so you have enough space

Having fun with other people outside

- Saw a couple of people skipping and so I skipped past them
- Saw some people doing an airplane run so I did it as I went by

Getting shouts out is always cool, even just to make it seem like they didn't hate the act.

Consistently doing a physical activity helps you see understand the actual effects of treating your body poorly, through your diet. After a night of drinking or eating unhealthy food that doesn't yield proper energy you can really feel it the next jog, especially long one. Mentally foggy and thoughts of giving up. But you have to make the decision to not give up beforehand, the moment before you eat that burger, nachos, and 6 beers if you really do want to achieve your goal and not fall behind the decision should already be cut into the stone walls of your mind. Sometimes the things you do might not even seem bad but your body will let you know.

Pain can even be caused by other muscle groups being weaker than the primary muscles that get trained through running. Personally I have felt shoulder joint pain and lower back. I should train these muscle groups past the point of them affecting my main activity, but not to take the spotlight. I need to incorporate suplimental training too.

Cramps, mostly I only get them now in my calves. But when I was less consistent with it and eating worse I did get them in my belly area.

Running high, I feel only after at least 40 minutes. Breathing in lots of air through your nose when your body desperately needs it gets a tingling sensation in my head.

After finishing a half marathon today, I laid on the grass and looked into the partly cloudy sky and saw the clouds doing some mild swirly movements. That was more probably from being light headed and exhausted. So much in fact I decided to spend $7 on a scooter home instead of walking.
