I don't live in the most glamorous apartment. A joy that comes with that are the coin-operated washing machine and dryer. After getting tired of bringing a $10 bill (it's all about the Hamilton's baby!) to QFC in exchange for a roll of quarters every 3 weeks or so I finally made a trip to my bank. Long story short, I returned with 400 quarters.

I mentioned this at a Hallowe'en party because I am an excellent conversationalist and my friend @troyvancamp said that if I find a quarter older than `1965` that it is worth around `$5` instead of `$0.25`. That's like 20 times what I paid for it, the song Money by Pink Floyd immediately started to play in my head and in that moment I felt like Mr. Krabs, dollar signs in my eyes. I was about to become a very rich man :money_with_wings:

I get home that night at around 2:30 AM but the adrenaline scourging through my veins, or does adrenaline scourge through some other organ... anyways I started to strip down those quarters from their pathetic paper armor and sort them by year, praying to see the Godly 1964 embossment.

Here's some statistics on the quarters I had received from the bank

[Quarters Excel](/assets/quarters.xlsx)

|      | 0  | 1  | 2 | 3 | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  |
|------|----|----|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 196x |    |    |   |   |    | 3  | 1  | 4  |    | 1  |
| 197x | 2  | 1  |   | 3 | 2  |    | 4  |    | 5  | 6  |
| 198x | 2  | 4  | 8 | 5 | 2  | 3  | 4  | 2  | 1  | 6  |
| 199x | 4  | 6  | 3 | 3 | 8  | 4  | 3  | 3  | 8  | 14 |
| 200x | 19 | 10 | 7 | 5 | 6  | 12 | 6  | 7  | 7  | 1  |
| 201x |    | 6  | 2 | 8 | 13 | 20 | 25 | 18 | 20 | 24 |
| 202x | 19 |    |   |   |    |    |    |    |    |    |

Compare the ratios of quarters I have with the amount created from 1965-Present
i.e. of ~400 quarters I have 3 from 1965. That's 0.75%.
What is [number of quarters made in 1965] divided by [all the quarters produced from 1965 to 2021]?
It should probably be close to 0.75%, for most of the years. Maybe some dates I have outliers to this trend, like I may have a disproportionate amount of 1993 quarters compared to the ones put out into circulation.
The more recent coins will also just have a better chance of still existing in circulation since older quarters have had like 50 more years of time to get lost, destroyed, collected, etc. removing them form circulation. I hope to still see a sort of linear trend in this graph.

Something even just looking at my quarters I can see that there definitely was a slow down on quarter production during the housing market crash of 2008.
