I've had android phones since I've had phones. Namely 3, HTC One M7 [2014-2016], Oneplus 5 [2017-2020], Pixel 4a 5G [2020-2022]. Now the iPhone 14 Pro [2022-Present].

Here is a list of the annoyances I've run into

- Notification Centre
  - Shows notifications I already have seen a full day ago?
  - Swipe down then swipe up to show notifications, that's two whole swipes!
  - Instagram notifications for a particular chat don't go away when I opened that chat!
- top of keyboard showing app store and photos by default
  - can switch to word guess
- keyboard makes using numbers and symbols a pain in the ass, wish it had the swipe down or long press for the symbol like on the iPad
- notifications coming through on both my iPhone and iPad, there can be delays too so I get double the amount of noise, how can I say notify me on this device only right now
- cannot fully disable animations
- no notification history like on android, if i click a notification and didn't read it this can make it go away and I'm not sure what interaction or whatever to look for in the now open app.
- autocorrect not fixing simple obvious mistakes, including im to i'm or eould to would.
- cannot name a timer. what if i forget what to do after my 48 hour timer goes off...
- twitter: not related to iOS but I lost all my drafts!! i guess they're stored locally on each device for some stupid reason.
- default taking live photos, how can i delete the live part of the pictures i've taken so far?
- enable location on photos
- save common timers (laundry, dryer)
- apple home needs an apple tv or an apple home speaker
- setup face-id with mask even if you don't really wear masks since it will help when laying in bed or have a blanket up to your nose.
- ios could easily share an image by "alt tabbing" and clicking on the photo icon from any app.
- easy to scrub along in song when running by accident
  - i can turn off lift to wake screen to resolve this but i kinda liked that, now i'd have to lift phone and tap screen.
- imessage limiting reactions to 6 things.
- i was able to move around my cursor through a message using the spacebar somehow. it was nice.
- going back in some apps is different. android had dedicated button. snapchat swipe right to leave a chat. other apps is swipe left. some don't have it at all? imessage feels like i have to swipe from the left absolute edge of the screen
- imessage doesn't sync the conversations I've deleted. so when I go on my iPad I see all the stupid auth codes
- sharing live photos should default to the static photo
- when downloading an app, the ability to download it to my other iOS device(s) would be nice. possible on the google play store!

## Better than Android

- thought i had to click all the way through bluetooth menu to disconnect from bluetooth device but its actually just the one press very nice!
- siri is actually good, although i never really used google assistant.
- shortcuts are cool, need to use more and create ones for myself!
- sharing + cropping screenshots, can immediately delete after sending to someone
- autofill from messages for auth codes
