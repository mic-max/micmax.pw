title: Hyphen vs. Underscore
---

in which scenarios one should be used over the other

- filename
- uri

reasons

- ctrl+shift selections
- place on keyboard. same key but need shift to get the underscore
- readability
- using both: e.g. `My_File_Is_Cool-01.png` shows that "My File Is Cool" and "01" are two separate ideas
- hyphenated word like: `brother-in-law` if it appears in a filename that already has hyphens it is less clear this is a hypenated word.
- married people who join their last names. what if two hypenated last name humans marry each other.
  - e.g. `Bob A-B` marries `Mary C-D` does their last name become `A-B-C-D` or `C-D-A-B`? can the order of the original last names `A-B` and `C-D` be broken up to form `A-C-B-D`? What about removing the hypen from the original last names so we maintain a single hypen per last name `AB-CD` or `CD-AB`?
