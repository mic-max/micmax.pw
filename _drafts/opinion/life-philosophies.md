Do what you need to do so that you can do what you want to do.
One of my favourite qualities in friends is that they can be down for whatever, whenever.
To make yourself available to impromptu events, you should have already done what you need to do.
An example of this is while in school finishing your homework on Friday night right after getting home. That way if there's anything that comes up that weekend you can attend. It also won't be in the background of your mind while you are trying to enjoy yourself.
