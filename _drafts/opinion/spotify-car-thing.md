title: Spotify Car Thing Review
---

price

Not better than a phone in the car with android auto.

Uses

- "Hey Spotify, pause" When my Spotify is playing on a device that I'm not near and said device does not have any audio commands like my phone or my computer (my sonos speakers have alexa on them)
- Controlling spotify and seeing what song is playing at my desk without opening spotify app
  - toggle shuffle, back, pause, forward, toggle like (middle 3 options my keyboard has a fn key for but they are not very convenient to press quickly Fn + F4, F6, and F7)
  - 4 speeddial buttons for artists
- Hands free song selection on my computer! Good if I don't want to alt + tab to open search and select a particular song or artist.
- The volume control (keyboard has but it's Fn + F1, F2 which make it a 2 handed action) I also have a touch slider volume control on my speakers but I guess that changes the volume of my whole system and not Spotify specifically. It also affects volume if I was playing on my sonos speakers, however using those while at my desk seems like an odd decision...

Need to make a better mount for it, under monitor or secured to my simple audio listen speakers.

Cons

- The screen is a little laggy to my inputs, it also has to use my phone as the middleman when I change a song from my pc -> phone -> car thing. so I think that's a little laggy but ill measure how long this takes TODO!
- It needs to be connected to my phone and can't just be connected to my PC over bluetooth
- Cannot be powered by all USB wall adapters. For instance my 5v 4A Oneplus charger didn't work. But it did work being plugged into my power bar's USB port. TODO: include amazon link
- Can't change the device Spotify is playing on from it (if I want to switch from my phone to my computer for example)
