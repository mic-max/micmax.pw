title: Lyrics to Ponder
---

How am I supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?

You've had too much of the digital love
You want everything live, you want things you can touch

She got me thinkin' there's a spark
Then she pull the plug, lights out, she go dark

There's a time when every man draws a line down in the sand

But every time a problem ends, another one begins

I love a girl that don't even fuckin' need a boy

Wisdom's a gift, but you'd trade it for youth

Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it

Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason

Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie 'bout anything at all?

A gardener told me some plants move

Sometimes, all I think about is you

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

If I'd known you sold on maybe
I'd a let you waste another guy

I used to think I love you, now I know it ain't true
Now I know it's not you, 50 on my boxers

She ain't answer me, so you know that I gotta shoot two at her

If you broke and your man don't teach you, get rid of him

I would never put a knife in your back
The love I give is her is kinda creepy but fuck it
She orders and I deliver

Since when did "I wanna hear your voice" not become a good excuse?
Calling you three in the morning, laugh at sleep that we'll both lose

For the warning signs I’ve completely ignored
There’s an amount to take, reasons to take more

I don't think I know who you are anymore
And I don't think I knew who I was before
In my own home I've never been more
Unsure, no

I just wanna see you smile
I just wanna make you mine

I don't wanna think about you (Nah, nah)
Every time I think about you (You)
I swear I fall in love again (Damn)
I remember everything you said
Promise me it's real (Yeah)
Girl, I got a deal (Got a deal)
You could be my girl if I could be your world

Baby, how you doing? I know you're not doing the best, but I'm here, I'll always be here
Tell me if you need me and call me if you feelin alone 'cause I'm here, I'm always right here

We're still the kids we used to be

You know it's been so long since you've been in my arms
I'm going home where I'll be all alone tonight

I don't even dream about her everynight
Can't you tell that I'm lying?

I'll never give your love away

There's no other place that I'd rather stay
Than inside your mind

I am not who I want to be
I probably will not ever be

We're still the kids we used to be
