title: Lyrics to Ponder
---

How am I supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?

You've had too much of the digital love
You want everything live, you want things you can touch

She got me thinkin' there's a spark
Then she pull the plug, lights out, she go dark

There's a time when every man draws a line down in the sand

But every time a problem ends, another one begins

I love a girl that don't even fuckin' need a boy

Wisdom's a gift, but you'd trade it for youth

Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
...
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason

Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie 'bout anything at all?

A gardener told me some plants move

Sometimes, all I think about is you

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

If I'd known you sold on maybe
I'd a let you waste another guy

I used to think I love you, now I know it ain't true
Now I know it's not you, 50 on my boxers

She ain't answer me, so you know that I gotta shoot two at her

If you broke and your man don't teach you, get rid of him

I would never put a knife in your back
The love I give is her is kinda creepy but fuck it
She orders and I deliver

Since when did "I wanna hear your voice" not become a good excuse?
Calling you three in the morning, laugh at sleep that we'll both lose

For the warning signs I’ve completely ignored
There’s an amount to take, reasons to take more

I don't think I know who you are anymore
And I don't think I knew who I was before
In my own home I've never been more
Unsure, no

I just wanna see you smile
I just wanna make you mine

I don't wanna think about you (Nah, nah)
Every time I think about you (You)
I swear I fall in love again (Damn)
I remember everything you said
Promise me it's real (Yeah)
Girl, I got a deal (Got a deal)
You could be my girl if I could be your world

Baby, how you doing? I know you're not doing the best, but I'm here, I'll always be here
Tell me if you need me and call me if you feelin alone 'cause I'm here, I'm always right here

We're still the kids we used to be

You know it's been so long since you've been in my arms
I'm going home where I'll be all alone tonight

I don't even dream about her everynight
Can't you tell that I'm lying?

I'll never give your love away

There's no other place that I'd rather stay
Than inside your mind

I am not who I want to be
I probably will not ever be

If you feel good about yourself
I feel good about you

But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God

I am going to make it through this year if it kills me

A lot of people know me, but they don't know me well

I'm a busy person, got no time for lies; one of a kind
...
Nothin' to me's ever good enough
I could be workin' for 24 hours a day and think I never did enough

I'm killin' off my demons 'cause my soul's worth redeemin'

'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

Everybody think I'm cool, I don't like that

When you look at me and hate on me, I'm a mirror
If you look at me and don't like me what does that say about you?

Maybe I don't act the way I used to
Cause I don't feel the same about you
In fact that's a lie
I want you

So I gave him an ultimatum
And I said, "I can't just keep living and moving with you all over the United States without a commitment."
There's no certainty, you know, of a future, and I wanted to have children, and that was important to me, so, we got married
I'm not sure, I think I would've waited to find...
I probably would've held out longer to get married 'cause I, I just, I don't know
You never really know for sure, but I had serious doubts when I got married, and I, I should've listened to my heart more
'Cause when you're young, you're idealistic, and you think your love is gonna change a person, but it really doesn't
They are who they are. Think it might make slight modifications, but they basically are who they are, and who you see, and who you feel that they are
So be cautious when you're searching, and don't just give your love away

I love you always
Even if you're bad news

The fossils of my footsteps will be unearthed at a far off date, unknown
Impressed in concrete from walking home alone after walking you home

Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet
...
You don't see how your lies is affecting me?
You don't see how our life was supposed to be?

You were right about the stars
Each one is a setting sun

If I don't die or worse
I'm gonna need a nap

They said, "there's too much caffeine
In your bloodstream
And a lack of real spice in your life"

I need caffeine in my blood stream, I take caffeine in the blood stream
