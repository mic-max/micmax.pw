go through all my tweets. i've had the account since grade 10 (2012)

and rank them, include stats about retweets, likes, impressions, hashtags, images, replies
my likes and my retweets
most interacted with accounts
probably a way to export them from twitter into a JSON file or something..
can also use this as a springboard into some standup comedy bits... we'll see 😝
