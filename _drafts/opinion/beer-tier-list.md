title: Beer Tier List
---

After years of drinking beer I finally wanted to figure out which ones I liked and disliked. I feel a side-by-side comparison is the best way to determine these things. Even though I may be getting more relaxed with my rankings as I became more intoxicated :dizzy_face:

I wanted to cover most of the beers I'd buy, that were widely available in the USA. So, I made a trip to QFC and the local corner store for some of their finest brews :beer:. On `June 26, 2021` I invited some thirsty friends over to tackle this array of `15` types of beer and find their favourites. Keep in mind I have an aversion to stouts and very hoppy beers (not that any here were) while viewing my ranking.

The beers were sipped knowing full well which one was in your cup. Therefore, some slight preconceived `beer-bias` may have been in effect. Oh no, I guess I'll have to do an anonymous beer tier list v2 some day :wink:

| Tier                                   | Beers         |           |                   |                 |               |
|----------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| <span style = "color:#FF7676">S</span> | Stella Artois |           |                   |                 |               |
| <span style = "color:#FFC48A">A</span> | Sapporo       | Corona    | Miller High Life  | Dos Equis       |               |
| <span style = "color:#FFE38D">B</span> | Coors Light   | Bud Light | Pabst Blue Ribbon | Modelo Especial | Coors Banquet |
| <span style = "color:#FFFF8F">C</span> | Fosters       | Budweiser | Busch             | Heineken        |               |
| <span style = "color:#C3FF89">D</span> | Guinness      |           |                   |                 |               |

_`S` is the best, each column is also ordered by how much I like. i.e. `Sapporo > Dos Equis`._

Some valuable information was learnt from this tasting session and I am happy I did it, and shared the experience with friends. It actually spawned a seltzer tasting a few months afterwards.

- I will not buy myself anything <span style = "color:#FFFF8F">C</span> <span style = "color:#C3FF89">or below</span>, Heineken was suprisingly low.
- Miller High Life is the `Champagne of Beers`
- Budweiser is the `King of Beers`

Beers I would have been happy to have include

- Michelob Ultra
- Sam Adams
- Bud Light Lime
- Rainier
- Blue Moon
- Red Stripe
- Old Milwaukee
- Tecate

PS: I didn't copy [Ludwig](https://youtu.be/l0gWQtLjwKc) he just so happened to do the same thing a week earlier. I had been planning to do this for over a month, just ask @sam!
