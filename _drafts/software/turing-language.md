title: Turing Programming Language
---

My first programming language. Turing. It *was* complete.

Explain my introduction to programming and what my first programs were.
Include some code to minesweeper, snake, paint, anything else I can find.

I remember wanting to do a YouTube tutorial series in tha language, maybe I could still whip one up and become clouted amongst highschool Ontarians :joy:

TODO: Should I move them into a single repository for misc code?

## Turing

install quickstart guide
runthrough basic syntax + some libraries i used, gfx and input

## Snake

https://github.com/mic-max/snake

## Paint

https://github.com/mic-max/paint

## Minesweeper

https://github.com/mic-max/minesweeper

This one would actually come first if I ordered this chronologically by coding date. However, I only made modifications to the version coded by my friend @RyanRossiter_

## Review

Even though it may be cringe to look back at things you've done in the past, it is actually a good thing since its indicative of progress and important in the pursuit of growth.

- Do negative checks at beginning of function and return immediately rather than nesting everything in an if-statement
- Use less magic numbers
- Game loop
