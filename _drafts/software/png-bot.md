title: PNG Optimizing Bot
---

Make a pngbot - similar to dependabot
- It will watch repositories for any PNG images being added
- It will attempt to compress them and create a PR if any were able to be compressed further
- How will people get this bot to run on their repositories? Signup somehow?
  - Only run on the default branch - main/master
