title: Terrible Speech Synthesizer
---

The only files I will allow myself to create audible speech is me saying each of the 26 letters in the alphabet. It will be the ultimate test of the "sound it out" method.

The challenge will be to play these letter WAV files in a way to best emulate most words.

Some ideas I already have

- Change the length of how long the letter plays. (Can I use only half of an audio file, W will be impossible if not, or do a variable speed so first 5/6ths are fast and the last 1/6th is slow and takes up like 80% of the time.)
- Overlay letters, for example There, the t is very soft, but we also want to differentiate it from here. So playing t and h simultaneously might get that th sound.
- Different modifications depending on letter before and after, important if it is the first or last letter too.

## Reach Goal

Add all the different pronunciations for letters, that fancy pronunciation alphabet used in the dictionary.
