dashboard for credit cards (progress toward getting dividends, credit card usage to goal), bank, stocks/401k, data usage (phone / xfinity), jogs, weight, electricity usage

would result in maybe a webpage that runs on my home-server (no internet access) that performs some API queries everyday or hour to update a local database that the webpage pulls from. on my client PC it could refresh the page every 5 minutes or whatever.

might be possible to do some of these dashboard widgets on the pixlet that I'm getting 32x64 screen.
