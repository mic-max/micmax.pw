When going to the Your Orders page on Amazon it shows a list of all the orders you made in the last 3 months.
I would like a view where it shows all the packages that haven't arrived yet.
Show them in order maybe on a timeline with the items.

Something like the following:

 V Elgato Cam Link                                                        v James Acaster - Perfect Sound Whatever
 v HDMI Cable                  v ------------ Revolver Album ------------ v                            v ---------- The Purple Pillow --------- v
 v Hanging Plant     v Kinect AC Adapter                                  v James Acaster - Classic Scrapes
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 Dec 28        Dec 29        Dec 30         Dec 31         Jan 1         Jan 2         Jan 3         Jan 4         Jan 5         Jan 6         Jan 7

Even a command line program that outputs the above would be pretty useful!
And I get to use the Amazon API for the first time :smile:
