title: Windows Setup Script
---

Whenever I have to reset my PC after it gets bloated or keep BSODing for some reason I have to go through the ritual of making all the same changes to my settings, installing all the same software, setting all the same defaults, etcetera, etc.
What if I could make myself a little less depressed running through this exercise

Similar to .dotfiles for Unix, but Windows.
Have a file with all download links and checklist for things to change that cannot be automated.
