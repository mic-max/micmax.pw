Show on my Pixlet my league ranking, and all game mode ranks too.

Script idea: get all games I've played includes player their elo and result.
 then fetch all their current ELO's. and see who has gone up or down the most.
 then print out the biggest movers. and if i beat them or not. other chess.com api stuff could be done.
