tweet each frame of a movie or tv show episode
90 minute movie is 129600 frames. 1 a day would take 355 years
tweeting a frame each second interval in the movie once a day would take around 15 years.
ideally i want to end up with a timeframe of 1-2 years maybe..
so i'd have to tweet about 7-15 times a day.
selecting these frames doesn't have to be a constant interval either. it could be handchosen to get the most interesting frame or decided upon using AI.
