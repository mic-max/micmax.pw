title: Useful CLI Programs
---

When you want to do some simple lookup and using a search engine or complete GUI application seems odd. Stay in the CLI for longer with some of these programs I've found useful!

Ideally, when possible, they would be offline programs.

## Shortlist

Here's a list of the programs and how to run them. They may have been aliased to a longer command with my prefered CLI args.

- [Area Codes](#us-area-codes) `areacode xxx`
- [Weather](#weather) `weather`
- [Stock](#stock-price) `stock xxx`

## Install All

`npm i -g us-area-codes cli-weather stocks`

## US Area Codes

Sometimes you get a text or phone call from an unknown number and want to lookup where its from. Also in media like music they are said quite a bit so it can be useful to look these up quickly.

[GitHub Link](https://github.com/mikemcbride/us-area-codes)
Install with `npm i -g us-area-codes` and run with `us-area-codes 206`.

It's not that accurate because it says `206` is `Washington` but Seattle would be more precise.

## Weather

Simply get the weather.

[Github Link](https://github.com/pizzimathy/cli-weather) Install with `npm i -g cli-weather` and run with `weather --can -z 98104`.

## Stock Price

To get information about a stock.

[GitHub Link](https://github.com/zackurben/stocks) Install with `npm i -g stocks` and run with `stocks -r xxx`.

TODO it doesn't work. replace with a different one.
