Pick a TV show and download the entirety of it: Seinfeld, MitM, Always Sunny, etc.
and run some program on it to determine statistics about the characters. time in each episode, who is in a scene with who, minutes spoken, words spoken, etc.
I've seen this done before, ex: https://youtu.be/mpRn5jXJ4Jw
