title: Multi-Source Media Player
---

A media player that allows the customisation of all the streams.
A stream being the webcame, screen capture, system audio, microphone audio, music audio, etc.

You can change the quality received for each stream, position/audio channel, whether to even receive it or not.
Some things like chat replay would not even have to be streamed, it could just be enabled and configured with the channel name. So the streamer is not uploading that constant scrolling chatbox which the change in pixels will add up to some bandwidth, definitely more than just fetching the chat logs yourself. Especially since you're already in the chat, so it would be no network overhead on the client side.
There can be some preconfigured sensible defaults provided at the startup, like phone portrait mode, desktop top quality, etc.
Synchronisation might be the issue and why this is not commonplace.

Essentially I want to have OBS controls and be able to tweak the view myself.
