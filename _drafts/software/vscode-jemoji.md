title: Jemoji Support in VS Code
---

It is annoying to open the website <https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/>

I'd like to maybe convert emojis into their :colon_format: if available or just type a command to add an jemoji and be able to filter through them all similar to the `Win + .` menu.
