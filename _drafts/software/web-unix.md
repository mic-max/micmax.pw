title: Web Hosted Unix Commands
---

Have typical commands like cat, diff, file, etc. all hosted from a website
smallpdf
also add stuff like gif to webp conversion tools.
what kind of backend would be best for running simple binary program wrappers. azure functions, aws lambda, vm with node express server?
page to do some operation shows all the binary programs it uses and what version they are.

also include instructions on how they could achieve the same result locally with free programs for any operating system

anything in my useful cli would probably be useful here
qr code generator

- other generators: unique username, company, etc.

and if I get lots of traffic then I could monetize this. to reduce server costs ideally anything not too intensive could be done client-side in JS or WASM
