get some 4g hardware since the SIM 800L that I bought only operates on 2G networks, of which USA doesn't have anymore.

might be able to use a cheap android phone with a sim card and communicate with it over ADB. so the phone is connected to a PC with a USB cable and the program that I write will need to be sending ADB commands. To make a call it will also probably need some microphone trickery so it uses some stream of audio data, perhaps from a file, rather than the phone of my computers microphone.
