title: Spotify Monthly Playlists
---

Lots of people create playlists for the current month and then will eventually have a whole catalog of songs they discovered over the months going back years.

I would like to automate this.

On the first of a month, grab all the songs I liked last month, and put them in a playlist.

Support backfilling.
