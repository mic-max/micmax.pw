Meaning to me:
I first heard and started listening to this album in June 2019 mentioned by my friend Eric Plourde right after I had moved from home to Seattle.
I’m really into nostalgia so songs like #4 really get me.

Tracklist:

We Begged 2 Explode - 3:44
“We begged to explode”: Hoping to die by some accident so you don’t get blamed like you would for a suicide
“Friends will disappear”: but Harvey will be with me for his whole life and will meet all the people I bring into my home.
Who wants to get married and have a family?
“... come and save me” so emotional into a scream with the instruments crescendo 👌 make it that much more powerful
This song also starts off pretty slow to this faster paced album which reminded me of Logic’s first album “Under Pressure” where he sings the first song on a rap album.

Pash Rash - 1:42
“I’ve been doing this for half my years”: Having a midlife crisis at age 33?
“... while we make out in your car … fuck the haters who object”: I thought this was a pretty sweet line, showing that he doesn’t let random people interfere with his love for her
Anyone listen to The Cribs?
He wants to see her in person, not off some phone screen
Pash Rash definition: “An unfortunate rash on the face which results from kissing somebody with a beard”

Festival Song - 2:54
Flows into from the last song with the lyrics “I want the song of the American dorm room”
Killer sounding buzzing in the beginning of the song
Message: Big companies only exist to make money off of you, your best interests are none of their concern.
Jeff is so evidently against the establishment but knows he has to play their game to get his message out to any considerably large number of people.
Aesthetic
The irony of using websites like Facebook to start meetings or protests against those very same things.
The strife of OSS community members and indie musicians is quite similar to anti-capitalistic mentalities and Jeff references technology frequently.



Staring Out The Window At Your Old Apartment - 3:21
Has anyone gone back to an old apartment they used to live in or maybe their childhood room has been repurposed, how did that feel?
I like to revisit places that felt significant to me at one time and reminisce.
I really like the line “Imagining the old you stumbling through” because it makes you reflect on your life in that old home. What you would leave for: groceries, go to the bus stop, jogging routes and also all the late night returns.
I enjoy this song and its simplicity

Wave Goodnight To Me - 2:59
Gentrification

To Be A Ghost … - 4:02
Blackbird - The Beatles
Police brutality
“Hate’s not a fad that dies with its virality”
Can almost hear the song’s words being played by the guitar in the instrumental break

Pietro, 60 Years Old - 0:38
First song of the medley?
Actually a good little song, most of the time I listen to an album and there’s 30 second “songs” I usually skip them.

I Did Something Weird Last Night - 3:11
“Everything so unexpectedly started to change in the dream. But I was preoccupied with how the magic would end” This was super relatable to me at the time when I first moved to Seattle to work at Microsoft. It felt like my luck was going too well and was going to end soon. I’d even describe how I got my job by saying I tricked the interviewers, so maybe a bit of imposter syndrome there.
Staying up late with someone <3 and having to nap the next day

Blast Damage Days - 2:54
“Halcyon” – denoting a period of time in the past that was idyllically happy and peaceful.
“Weeks slipping away” - after reflecting on this summer though I had fun and spent a lot of time hanging out with friends, I don’t feel as fulfilled as I hope to feel in using my spare time. A lot of it ends up being consuming, rather than creating.
“...These are the mass murder days...” Jeff really starts shouting until the end of the song really emphasizing how fucked the world currently is, yet the irony is that these are his halcyon days, meaning he expects it to just keep going downhill.

Bang On The Door - 1:02
Love the hard start to this song!
Fear of being evicted.
In the second verse he is explaining the toll of living in these conditions of uncertainty with your shelter which is one of the base pieces of pavlov’s hierarchy of needs. It prevents his apartment from ever feeling like home.
Do you guys feel at home in Seattle? If so, when did that feeling start and do you know why?

Rainbow - 1:30
“Caulking the cracks that stretch across the ceiling” callback to song #4 where one of his previous apartments also had cracks in the wall
“...a storm cloud pissing rainbows on the cubes that blossomed on our old street...” so accurate. These new buildings honestly are such eyesores among the cool stone architecture of the early 1900s.
Again in the end of this song he is pleading they don’t take his love away, sure the constant moving is shitty but it doesn’t destroy him.

Planet Luxury - 0:29
Yup...

HELLLLHOOOOLE - 1:46
Not wanting to be a cog in a machine that doesn’t care about us.
Red flag: When people you work with use “family” terminology
Landlords are the assholes. It is too profitable of a business that only people with existing capital can enter.
There’s also the issue of homelessness and empty properties which both seem to be ignored since they’re not a problem for the rich. They don’t see them from their house in the Hills.

June 21st - 1:03
Gotta play this song on the date!
Seasonal depression comes to an end
I actually like the winter, I sweat less

The Fuzz - 1:58
Meaning: “So as we time out half-assed platforms as the victims form a line”

... While You’re Alive - 1:53
Second half of song #6 “To be a ghost while you’re alive”
One of my favourite song on the album
Would you want to die before or after your spouse? Jeff clearly would be torn to pieces if it were the latter. That doesn’t mean he’d prefer it though.
“Everybody loves you when you die But when it matters, they’re not there” reminded me of not a death, but in grade 6 my best friend moved to another city and seeing everyone else was showing so much sadness or whatever when I knew they weren’t friends. Being fake is so gross to me.

Perfect Sound Whatever - 2:35
There’s no perfect time to do something, just like you’ll never just come across free time to do all those things you planned to do. Your life will stay on its current trajectory unless you act upon it.
