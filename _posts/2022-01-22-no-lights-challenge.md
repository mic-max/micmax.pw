title: "!Lights Challenge"
---

At one of my first hackathons, I participated in a challenge called `!lights`.
The goal was to recreate a webpage in a limited amount of time, using only a text editor, and having to drink a shot of hot sauce.
For just a moment, life felt like a movie; things were getting a little heated :fire:

## QHacks

This challenge was hosted by `QHacks` in 2017 at [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca).
Attending this hackathon and visiting my sister(s) on my birthday :aquarius: weekend became a tradition over the next couple years.
Taking the sponsored bus or making the two hour drive myself from Ottawa down to Kingston to get my hack on, game & drink at [barcadia](https://www.barcadia.ca), and couchsurfing at my sister's - too good to pass up.

I scoured QHacks' Facebook albums and found some photographs featuring yours truly :camera:

## The Challenge

For the uninitiated, the `!` symbol is a unary operator in many programming languages called the logical NOT operator.
It is used to reverse the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make it false, and vice versa.
All of this is to say that, the `!Lights` means no lights, since participants couldn't check what the website would render to while writing it.
Apologies to all you programmers that didn't need my long-winded explanation :pensive:

> In hacker culture, the exclamation mark is called "bang", "shriek", or, in the British slang known as Commonwealth Hackish, "pling".

I didn't know about this challenge beforehand, so I had no chance to get in any kind practice.
Luckily, I was fairly comfortable with HTML and CSS at the time.

I don't remember if I connected the dots at the time... but this is was _definitely_ based off the scene above.
If you haven't seen [The Social Network](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/) what are you doing!
This is one of my favourite movies, the hacking scenes in it hype me up, I'm a big fan of [Jesse Eisenberg](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0251986/), and to this day I still listen to its [beautiful soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/album/1ijkFiMeHopKkHyvQCWxUa?si=f7c60f7486c24fd9).

Thanks `Wayback Machine` for backing up the Internet! Truly doing God's work :pray:
Here's what Facebook's registration page looked like in February 2017

## Results

So ya, this is what `facebook.com` could have looked like... if I was the only developer working in these horrible conditions

## Chamber of Reflection

How I would modify my approach

- Images don't work, replace them with a CSS gradient, emoji, or ASCII art
- Match the colours better, <span style="background-color: rgb(60, 89, 152)">rgb(60, 89, 152)</span> and I used <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 255)">rgb(0, 0, 255)</span>
- Include all content first, then work on styling
- Use a more similar font, sans-serif at least

### Aside

The birthday input being made of dropdowns allows people to say they were born on February 30, which is probably handled after clicking the `Create Account` button, but it's funny the input even allows for invalid values.
HTML5 has a [date input type](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/att_input_type_date.asp) that could have been used to avoid this possibility...

## Fun facts

- My Mom and both of my sisters, @heathermaxwelll and @jenn_maxwell, went to Queen's
- I had my phone interview with [$MSFT](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/MSFT:NASDAQ) `Feb 1, 2019 at 10am`
- I still have the email I sent almost exactly 5 years ago!
- It definitely cleaner with the `the`, thanks JT :innocent:
