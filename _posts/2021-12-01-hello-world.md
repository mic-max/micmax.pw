---

Hello and welcome to my first post!\
I want to motivate myself to work on ideas I have and able to share them with people.\
So here I am making this blog...  I'll name it `Michael's Motive` :sparkles:

Some topics I'll write about in the future include

- DIY Projects
- Opinions
- Music
- Photography
- Software

Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the Internet. I hope you enjoy your stay :smiley:

The obligatory non-English version

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
