title: Beer Tier List
---

After years of drinking beer I finally wanted to figure out which ones I _actually_ liked. I think doing side-by-side comparisons is a great way to figure that out... even though may rankings might be affected by my rising blood alcohol concentration :dizzy_face:

I mostly wanted to cover popular and widely available beers with this ranking. So, I made a trip to QFC and the local corner store for some of their finest brews :beer:. On `June 26, 2021` I invited some of my _thirsty_ friends over to tackle this array of `15` beers and to find their favourites. The beers were sipped knowing full well which one was in your cup. Therefore, some slight preconceived `beer-biases` may have been in effect... Oh no! I guess I'll have to do an anonymous beer tier list some day :wink:. While viewing my ranking, keep in mind that I have an aversion to stouts and hoppy beers.

| Tier                                   | Beers         |           |                   |                 |               |
|----------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| <span style = "color:#FF7676">S</span> | Stella Artois |           |                   |                 |               |
| <span style = "color:#FFC48A">A</span> | Sapporo       | Corona    | Miller High Life  | Dos Equis       |               |
| <span style = "color:#FFE38D">B</span> | Coors Light   | Bud Light | Pabst Blue Ribbon | Modelo Especial | Coors Banquet |
| <span style = "color:#FFFF8F">C</span> | Fosters       | Budweiser | Busch             | Heineken        |               |
| <span style = "color:#C3FF89">D</span> | Guinness      |           |                   |                 |               |

_`S` is the best, each column is also ordered by how much I like. i.e. `Sapporo > Dos Equis`._\

This tasting actually spawned a [seltzer tasting]({% link _posts/2022-09-27-hard-seltzer-tier-list.md %}) a couple months later, hosted by @yelli_r :cocktail: so I consider this a success. Some valuable information was learnt from this tasting session.

- I will not buy myself anything <span style = "color:#FFFF8F">C</span> <span style = "color:#C3FF89">or below</span>, Heineken was surprisingly low.
- Miller High Life is the `Champagne of Beers`
- Budweiser is the `King of Beers`

Beers I would have been happy to have include

- Blue Moon
- Bud Light Lime
- Michelob Ultra
- Old Milwaukee
- Rainier
- Red Stripe
- Sam Adams
- Tecate

PS: I didn't copy [Ludwig](https://youtu.be/l0gWQtLjwKc) he just so happened to do the same thing a week earlier. I had been planning to do this for over a month, just ask @sam!
