Here are some things I've drawn in reverse chronological order, some random doodles, and a list of nostalgia motivated subjects I want to draw in the future. I enjoy drawing and find it to be a good way to relax my mind. I will continue to update this post as I draw to preserve this monumental artwork for millennia :relieved:

### JavaScape

{{ 'October 6, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![JavaScape](/assets/drawings/javascape.png)
Was talking about JavaScript at work and recently have seen more RuneScape stuff in my Twitter feed. The amalgamation just seemed appropriate. Shoutout `Gasoline 87`! My first RuneScape account name.

### 99 Luftballons

{{ 'September 25, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![99 Luftballons](/assets/drawings/99-luftballons.jpg)
Quite a lovely song about 99 (red in the English remake) balloons being seen as UFO's and fighter jets sent to shoot down Tango.

### Clouded

![Little Guy Original](/assets/drawings/little-guy/1.png)
![Little Guy 2](/assets/drawings/little-guy/2.png)
![Little Guy Blue](/assets/drawings/little-guy/blue.png)
![Little Guy Red](/assets/drawings/little-guy/red.png)
Generated a little guy from Dalle-2 mini from a prompt like "guy being sad clouds raining tears" and I made a few variations on the resulting image. I really liked the style and made the original my [Chess.com profile](https://www.chess.com/member/micmax) picture.

<!-- TODO: include a copy of original, on work laptop IIRC -->

### The Sunset Tries

{{ 'January 17, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![The Sunset Tries](/assets/drawings/sunset-tries.jpg)
"The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes" - [Arabella by Arctic Monkeys](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nzsY8vlnKdvGOEE0rjAXZ?si=4102e6ec6a804fe7).

### Seattle Kraken

{{ 'January 12, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Seattle Kraken](/assets/drawings/seattle-kraken.jpg)
Gotta represent my city's new hockey franchise. Drew this in one of my restless 3AM. This logo is also top-tier, same goes for the alternate one :ok_hand:

### One Colour at a Time

{{ 'December 10, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![One Colour at a Time](/assets/drawings/one-colour-at-a-time.jpg)
I was killing time in the UW parking lot: _Ted Bundy_. I brought my pad and markers and decided I'd do some drawing. I didn't know what to draw so I just went colour by colour drawing random stuff without a single plan or thought in my head.

### Pyjamuel Samuel

{{ 'December 18, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Pyjamuel Samuel](/assets/drawings/pyjama-sam.jpg)
A game my sisters and I used to play that came as a prize in a cereal box. You collect cookie box tops and adventure through a society of  anthropomorphic cookies and sweets.

### Strawberry Fields Forever

{{ 'August 23, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Strawberry Fields Forever](/assets/drawings/strawberry-fields-forever.jpg)
One of my [favourite songs](https://youtu.be/HtUH9z_Oey8). I wanted to personify the berries. I really love this one.

### Arthur's Knee | Incomplete

{{ 'August 17, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Arthur's Knee at the Dump](/assets/drawings/arthur.jpg)
From the scene in [this Arthur episode](https://arthur.fandom.com/wiki/Arthur%27s_Knee) permanently etched into my memory. Painted this thanks to my friend @yelli_r for providing all the supplies and driving us to [Gas Works Park](http://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/gas-works-park)!

### Caterpillar Chrysalis

{{ 'July 16, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Caterpillar Sleeping Bag](/assets/drawings/caterpillar.jpg)
My friends and I camped out the night before hiking [Mount St. Helens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_St._Helens). I did not have a sleeping bag. I bought a sleeping bag. It had a place to put a paper. I drew on that paper. `PS: I am an idiot and got a terrible sunburn.`

### Mom Jeans

{{ 'July 13, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Mom Jeans](/assets/drawings/mom-jeans.jpg)
My friend @plourde_e suggested that I draw this after seeing something I drew that reminded him of it I believe... [Mom Jeans.](https://momjeansca.bandcamp.com/album/puppy-love) is a band that loves skateboarding puppies!

### Donnie Darko

{{ 'June 2, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Donnie Darko](/assets/drawings/donnie-darko.jpg)
One of my [favourite movies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246578/), I remember first watching this with my older sister @heathermaxwelll and being so confused. I've since rewatched it a bunch of times, went as Donnie for `Hallowe'en 2017`, and during my last rewatch session at `2AM` was inspired to draw this.

### Zoboomafoo

{{ 'April 14, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Zoboomafoo in Zobooland](/assets/drawings/zoboomafoo.jpg)
Another classic show from my childhood. This actually became the basis for my online identity `Lemur` (mispronounced by many) starting in `~2011`. [Sifaka Lemurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sifaka) are my favourite animal and I drew this on a weekend trip to [Pacific City, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_City,_Oregon). I'm not too happy how this one turned out, too much solid colour.

### Axolotls

{{ 'April 1, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Axolotls](/assets/drawings/axolotls.jpg)
One of my favourite animals. I did a speech on the [Mexican Axolotl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl) in Grade 5 after seeing them in a magazine and being fascinated with them. I got a pencil case from a store in `Bellevue` which is how I  store my markers, this is a recreation of that design. `PS: Minecraft is stealing my thoughts...`

### Rude Dog

{{ 'March 5, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Rude Dog](/assets/drawings/rude-dog.jpg)
This is from a cartoon that my sisters and I would watch at my grandparents house called `Rude Dog & The Dweebs`. Here's a link to [Episode 1](https://youtu.be/aj3XSmBcOHs), at least give the theme song a watch :sweat_smile:

## Uncategorised / Doodles

![CA Love](/assets/drawings/ca-love.png)
<!-- TODO -->

![Colourful Cry Baby](/assets/drawings/cry-baby.png)
Soon after I got my iPad I drew the Lil Peep Cry Baby bird. I added some colour to the feather tips and some grid brushing. If it wasn't already obvious I am a big fan of his. RIP Gus.

![Hilltop Castle](/assets/drawings/hilltop-castle.jpg)
Reminiscing about a Scooby-Doo movie I wanted to draw from memory the castle from a scene. After drawing and looking up the movie to be [`Scooby-Doo! and the Reluctant Werewolf`](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0189072/) and comparing the two I was slightly disappointed, but I did try a technique: crosshatching!

![Lil Peep Mirror](/assets/drawings/lil-peep-mirror.jpg)
With each word being a palindrome in `Lil Peep`, it mirrors pretty well horizontally.

![Ferris Bueler Quote](/assets/drawings/ferris-bueler.jpg)
Don't miss it.

![Colours](/assets/drawings/colours.jpg)
How can I both make some decor for my apartment and drain these markers... two-bird style.

![Questionable Beast](/assets/drawings/beast.jpg)
Started with some question mark horns, questioned some authority, and then went aggressively outside the lines.

![Doodles](/assets/drawings/doodles.jpg)
First paper doodles including: Jack O' Lantern skin-walker, Medieval Michael in `Lil Uzi vs The World` style, les dents :fr:, [Beetman](https://americandad.fandom.com/wiki/Beetman), rainbow [Kiriboh](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kuriboh) damaged by :droplet:

![Whiteboard Organisms](/assets/drawings/whiteboard-organisms.jpg)
The humble whiteboard beginnings. Pineapple. Daisy. Blueberries. Kiwis. Grapefruit - guess my stance on them. Hey! Don't look at my checklist :boom:

![Zoboomafoo Profile](/assets/drawings/lemur.png)

I made this for my profile picture on the [Linus Tech Tips Forum](https://linustechtips.com/profile/787-prolemur/). I traced over a picture of the puppet I found on Google Images using `mspaint` and I use it for many of my more-anonymous online accounts.
