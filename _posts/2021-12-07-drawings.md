Here are some things I've drawn in reverse chronological order, some random doodles, and a list of nostalgia motivated subjects I want to draw in the future. I enjoy drawing and find it to be a good way to relax my mind. I will continue to update this post as I draw to preserve this monumental artwork for millennia :relieved:

### Zoboomafoo

{% figure caption:"Another classic show from my childhood. This actually became the basis for my online identity `Lemur` (mispronounced by many) starting in `~2011`. [Sifaka Lemurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sifaka) are my favourite animal and I drew this on a weekend trip to [Pacific City, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_City,_Oregon). I'm not too happy how this one turned out, too much solid colour." %}

I did a speech on the [Mexican Axolotl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl) in Grade 5 after seeing them in a magazine and being fascinated with them. I got a pencil case from a store in `Bellevue` which is how I  store my markers, this is a recreation of that design. `PS: Minecraft is stealing my thoughts...`" %}
