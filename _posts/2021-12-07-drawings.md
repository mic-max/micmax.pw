Here are some things I've drawn in reverse chronological order, some random doodles, and a list of nostalgia motivated subjects I want to draw in the future. I enjoy drawing and find it to be a good way to relax my mind. I will continue to update this post as I draw to preserve this monumental artwork for millennia :relieved:

### Michow

{{ 'December 14, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Michael Cow Name Tag](/assets/drawings/michow.png)
Before falling asleep in a melatonin daze I had the idea of going to some event where you put on a nametag and I would just mine to the shape of a cow and make the spots to form the letters of my name. Michael also kind of sounds like my cow, if you pronounce it like a toddler. I got up and sketch a rough concept which I minorly improved the next day and got this.

### Broken Social Scene

{{ 'December 10, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Broken Social Scene](/assets/drawings/broken-social-scene.png)
I drew this from memory on the clipper ferry back to Seattle from visiting my concussed sister in Victoria for a week. I had a dream that week I was at their concert and their grand finale was [We Will Rock You](https://youtu.be/-tJYN-eG1zk) which inspired me to recreate this album's artwork, done from memory!

### Pumpkins '22

{{ 'December 4, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Pumpkins 2022](/assets/drawings/pumpkins-2022.png)
My pumpkin is on the right and my date's was on the left. We went to Carpinito Bros. Pumpkin Patch and Corn Maze on October 23 and then carved them on my garbage bag covered kitchen floor. I started this drawing before she broke things off, so that's why it took me a month extra to finish it for myself. Her spider web was not as good as my drawing would have you believe by the way --- not being petty :wink:

### Michael ITM

{{ 'November 22, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Michael ITM](/assets/drawings/michael-itm.png)
I wanted to pay homage to an excellent show and one of my favourites. I had the original version as my twitter banner image and one night after having the idea to recreate it before a jog I did just that. Who wants to write a Michael in the Middle pilot!

### Fifth Plead

{{ 'November 9, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Fifth Plead](/assets/drawings/fifth-plead.png)
The idea hit me after I said I plead the fifth to Heather saying that I used Google Translate after I replied to my Mom in our family group chat in perfect French. I finished this one in the close-right corner of [Comet Tavern](https://thecomettavern.com/) on a rickety table alongside a couple pints.

### Bloom

{{ 'November 8, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Bloom](/assets/drawings/bloom.png)
Just a couple of buddies that like to hangout atop my fridge. His arms only move like that in his mind though. This was my first time using the bloom effect in Procreate and I did it _tastefully_ :joy:

### Human-Holing

{{ 'November 8, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Human-Holing](/assets/drawings/human-holing.png)
During a conversation with someone off a gummy so I was feeling very empathetic and they were telling a story about someone and said something along the lines of "oh you're one of these kinds of people". And I immediately was like "ouch", maybe that's fragile individualism ego of America but I thought it was pretty harsh. Kinda just sketched this idea up quickly in a rage.

### Little John Jewel Thief

{{ 'October 16, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Little John Jewel Kiss](/assets/drawings/jewel-kiss.png)
![Little John Jewel Thief](/assets/drawings/jewel-thief.png)
Two frames of Little John suckling the jewels from Prince John's rings. They really had trouble coming up with character names in this movie eh?

### Rye Theft

{{ 'October 9, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![You Wouldn't Steal A Rye](/assets/drawings/rye-thief.png)
Inspired by [my favourite scene in Seinfeld](https://youtu.be/QfuuXwQMDyE) and the age-old classic PSA [Piracy. It's a crime](https://youtu.be/HmZm8vNHBSU) which was superceeded by the [you wouldn't download a car meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/751150-piracy-its-a-crime). I am a proud user of `thepiratebay`, just ask my ISP! Quickly drew this at Cal Anderson Park.

### Alt-oids

{{ 'October 8, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Altoids Tin with Codeine Written on it](/assets/drawings/codeine.png)
Asked by someone I met before heading to a Lane 8 concert to make one for shrooms IIRC. I was showing people it because they were popping Altoids and someone joked about them being spiked. I don't unprompted show people my drawings at social gatherings!

### Subaru Fighter Jets

{{ 'October 7, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Subaru Logo made of Fighter Jets](/assets/drawings/subaru-jets.png)
People with bad vision probably make this mistake all the time. There's also a notable juxtaposition between military fighter jets and the political views of [subaru's target demographic](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/01/02/lesbians_and_subarus_why_do_lesbians_love_outbacks_and_foresters.html).

### JavaScape

{{ 'October 6, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![JavaScape](/assets/drawings/javascape.png)
Was talking about JavaScript at work and recently have seen more RuneScape stuff in my Twitter feed. The amalgamation just seemed appropriate. Shoutout `Gasoline 87`! My first RuneScape account name.

### 99 Luftballons

{{ 'September 25, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![99 Luftballons](/assets/drawings/99-luftballons.jpg)
Quite a lovely song about 99 (red in the English remake) balloons being seen as UFO's and fighter jets sent to shoot down Tango.

### Clouded

{{ 'September 9, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}

![Little Guy Original](/assets/img/little-guy.png)
![Little Guy 1](/assets/drawings/little-guy/1.png)
![Little Guy 2](/assets/drawings/little-guy/2.png)
![Little Guy Blue](/assets/drawings/little-guy/blue.png)
![Little Guy Red](/assets/drawings/little-guy/red.png)
The first image was generated from Dalle-2 mini from a prompt like "guy being sad clouds raining tears" and I made a few variations on the resulting image, the first matching the 256px resolution for some reason... I really liked the style and made the original my [Chess.com profile](https://www.chess.com/member/micmax) picture.

### The Sunset Tries

{{ 'January 17, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![The Sunset Tries](/assets/drawings/sunset-tries.jpg)
"The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes" - [Arabella by Arctic Monkeys](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nzsY8vlnKdvGOEE0rjAXZ?si=4102e6ec6a804fe7).

### Seattle Kraken

{{ 'January 12, 2022' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Seattle Kraken](/assets/drawings/seattle-kraken.jpg)
Gotta represent my city's new hockey franchise. Drew this in one of my restless 3AM. This logo is also top-tier, same goes for the alternate one :ok_hand:

### One Colour at a Time

{{ 'December 10, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![One Colour at a Time](/assets/drawings/one-colour-at-a-time.jpg)
I was killing time in the UW parking lot: _Ted Bundy_. I brought my pad and markers and decided I'd do some drawing. I didn't know what to draw so I just went colour by colour drawing random stuff without a single plan or thought in my head.

### Pyjamuel Samuel

{{ 'December 18, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Pyjamuel Samuel](/assets/drawings/pyjama-sam.jpg)
A game my sisters and I used to play that came as a prize in a cereal box. You collect cookie box tops and adventure through a society of  anthropomorphic cookies and sweets.

### Strawberry Fields Forever

{{ 'August 23, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Strawberry Fields Forever](/assets/drawings/strawberry-fields-forever.jpg)
One of my [favourite songs](https://youtu.be/HtUH9z_Oey8). I wanted to personify the berries. I really love this one.

### Arthur's Knee | Incomplete

{{ 'August 17, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Arthur's Knee at the Dump](/assets/drawings/arthur.jpg)
From the scene in [this Arthur episode](https://arthur.fandom.com/wiki/Arthur%27s_Knee) permanently etched into my memory. Painted this thanks to my friend @yelli_r for providing all the supplies and driving us to [Gas Works Park](http://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/gas-works-park)!

### Caterpillar Chrysalis

{{ 'July 16, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Caterpillar Sleeping Bag](/assets/drawings/caterpillar.jpg)
My friends and I camped out the night before hiking [Mount St. Helens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_St._Helens). I did not have a sleeping bag. I bought a sleeping bag. It had a place to put a paper. I drew on that paper. `PS: I am an idiot and got a terrible sunburn.`

### Mom Jeans

{{ 'July 13, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Mom Jeans](/assets/drawings/mom-jeans.jpg)
My friend @plourde_e suggested that I draw this after seeing something I drew that reminded him of it I believe... [Mom Jeans.](https://momjeansca.bandcamp.com/album/puppy-love) is a band that loves skateboarding puppies!

### Donnie Darko

{{ 'June 2, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Donnie Darko](/assets/drawings/donnie-darko.jpg)
One of my [favourite movies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246578/), I remember first watching this with my older sister @heathermaxwelll and being so confused. I've since rewatched it a bunch of times, went as Donnie for `Hallowe'en 2017`, and during my last rewatch session at `2AM` was inspired to draw this.

### Zoboomafoo

{{ 'April 14, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Zoboomafoo in Zobooland](/assets/drawings/zoboomafoo.jpg)
Another classic show from my childhood. This actually became the basis for my online identity `Lemur` (mispronounced by many) starting in `~2011`. [Sifaka Lemurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sifaka) are my favourite animal and I drew this on a weekend trip to [Pacific City, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_City,_Oregon). I'm not too happy how this one turned out, too much solid colour.

### Axolotls

{{ 'April 1, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Axolotls](/assets/drawings/axolotls.jpg)
One of my favourite animals. I did a speech on the [Mexican Axolotl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl) in Grade 5 after seeing them in a magazine and being fascinated with them. I got a pencil case from a store in `Bellevue` which is how I  store my markers, this is a recreation of that design. `PS: Minecraft is stealing my thoughts...`

### Rude Dog

{{ 'March 5, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Rude Dog](/assets/drawings/rude-dog.jpg)
This is from a cartoon that my sisters and I would watch at my grandparents house called `Rude Dog & The Dweebs`. Here's a link to [Episode 1](https://youtu.be/aj3XSmBcOHs), at least give the theme song a watch :sweat_smile:

## Uncategorised / Doodles

![CA Love](/assets/drawings/ca-love.png)
<!-- TODO -->

![Colourful Cry Baby](/assets/drawings/cry-baby.png)
Soon after I got my iPad I drew the Lil Peep Cry Baby bird. I added some colour to the feather tips and some grid brushing. If it wasn't already obvious I am a big fan of his. RIP Gus.

![Hilltop Castle](/assets/drawings/hilltop-castle.jpg)
Reminiscing about a Scooby-Doo movie I wanted to draw from memory the castle from a scene. After drawing and looking up the movie to be [`Scooby-Doo! and the Reluctant Werewolf`](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0189072/) and comparing the two I was slightly disappointed, but I did try a technique: crosshatching!

![Lil Peep Mirror](/assets/drawings/lil-peep-mirror.jpg)
With each word being a palindrome in `Lil Peep`, it mirrors pretty well horizontally.

![Ferris Bueler Quote](/assets/drawings/ferris-bueler.jpg)
Don't miss it.

![Colours](/assets/drawings/colours.jpg)
How can I both make some decor for my apartment and drain these markers... two-bird style.

![Questionable Beast](/assets/drawings/beast.jpg)
Started with some question mark horns, questioned some authority, and then went aggressively outside the lines.

![Doodles](/assets/drawings/doodles.jpg)
First paper doodles including: Jack O' Lantern skin-walker, Medieval Michael in `Lil Uzi vs The World` style, les dents :fr:, [Beetman](https://americandad.fandom.com/wiki/Beetman), rainbow [Kiriboh](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kuriboh) damaged by :droplet:

![Whiteboard Organisms](/assets/drawings/whiteboard-organisms.jpg)
The humble whiteboard beginnings. Pineapple. Daisy. Blueberries. Kiwis. Grapefruit - guess my stance on them. Hey! Don't look at my checklist :boom:

![Zoboomafoo Profile](/assets/drawings/lemur.png)

I made this for my profile picture on the [Linus Tech Tips Forum](https://linustechtips.com/profile/787-prolemur/). I traced over a picture of the puppet I found on Google Images using `mspaint` and I use it for many of my more-anonymous online accounts.
