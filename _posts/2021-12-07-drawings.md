Here are some things I've drawn in reverse chronological order, some random doodles, and a list of nostalgia motivated subjects I want to draw in the future. I enjoy drawing and find it to be a good way to relax my mind. I will continue to update this post as I draw to preserve this monumental artwork for millennia :relieved:

### One Colour at a Time

![One Colour at a Time](/assets/drawings/one-colour-at-a-time.jpg)
I was killing time in the UW parking lot, Ted Bundy. I brought my pad and markers and decided I'd do some drawing. I didn't know what to draw so I just went colour by colour drawing random stuff.

### Pyjamuel Samuel

A game my sisters and I used to play that came as a prize in a cereal box. Collecting cookie box tops and adventuring through some land full of anipromorphic cookies and sweets.

### Strawberry Fields Forever

![Strawberry Fields Forever](/assets/drawings/strawberry-fields-forever.jpg)
One of my [favourite songs](https://youtu.be/HtUH9z_Oey8). I wanted to personify the berries. I really love this one.

### Arthur's Knee | Incomplete

![Arthur's Knee at the Dump](/assets/drawings/arthur.jpg)
From the scene in [this Arthur episode](https://arthur.fandom.com/wiki/Arthur%27s_Knee) permanently etched into my memory. Painted this thanks to my friend @yelli_r for providing all the supplies and driving us to [Gas Works Park](http://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/gas-works-park)!

### Caterpilar Chrysalis

![Caterpillar Sleeping Bag](/assets/drawings/caterpillar.jpg)
My friends and I camped out the night before hiking [Mount St. Helens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_St._Helens). I did not have a sleeping bag. I bought a sleeping bag. It had a place to put a paper. I drew on that paper. `PS: I am an idiot and got a terrible sunburn.`

### Mom Jeans.

![Mom Jeans](/assets/drawings/mom-jeans.jpg)
My friend @plourde_e suggested that I draw this after seeing something I drew that reminded him of it I believe... [Mom Jeans.](https://momjeansca.bandcamp.com/album/puppy-love) is a band that loves skateboarding puppies!

### Donnie Darko

{{ 'June 2, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Donnie Darko](/assets/drawings/donnie-darko.jpg)
One of my [favourite movies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246578/), I remember first watching this with my older sister @heathermaxwelll and being so confused. I've since rewatched it a bunch of times, went as Donnie for `Hallowe'en 2017`, and during my last rewatch session at `2AM` was inspired to draw this.

### Zoboomafoo

{{ 'April 14, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Zoboomafoo in Zobooland](/assets/drawings/zoboomafoo.jpg)
Another classic show from my childhood. This actually became the basis for my online identity `Lemur` (mispronounced by many) starting in `~2011`. [Sifaka Lemurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sifaka) are my favourite animal and I drew this on a weekend trip to [Pacific City, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_City,_Oregon). I'm not too happy how this one turned out, too much solid colour.

### Axolotls

{{ 'April 1, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Axolotls](/assets/drawings/axolotls.jpg)
One of my favourite animals. I did a speech on the [Mexican Axolotl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl) in Grade 5 after seeing them in a magazine and being fascinated with them. I got a pencil case from a store in `Bellevue` which is how I  store my markers, this is a recreation of that design. `PS: Minecraft is stealing my thoughts...`

### Rude Dog

{{ 'March 5, 2021' | date: '%b %e, %Y' }}
![Rude Dog](/assets/drawings/rude-dog.jpg)
This is from a cartoon that my sisters and I would watch at my grandparents house called `Rude Dog & The Dweebs`. Here's a link to [Episode 1](https://youtu.be/aj3XSmBcOHs), at least give the theme song a watch :sweat_smile:

## Uncatagorized / Doodles

![Lil Peep Mirror](/assets/drawings/lil-peep-mirror.jpg)
With each word being a palindrome in `Lil Peep`, it mirrors pretty well horizontally.

![Ferris Bueler Quote](/assets/drawings/ferris-bueler.jpg)
Don't miss it.

![Colours](/assets/drawings/colours.jpg)
How can I both make some decor for my apartment and drain these markers... two-bird style.

![Questionable Beast](/assets/drawings/beast.jpg)
Started with some question mark horns, questioned some authority, and then went aggressively outside the lines.

![Doodles](/assets/drawings/doodles.jpg)
First paper doodles including: Jack O' Lantern skin-walker, Medieval Michael in `Lil Uzi vs The World` style, les dents :fr:, [Beetman](https://americandad.fandom.com/wiki/Beetman), rainbow [Kiriboh](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kuriboh) damaged by :droplet:

![Whiteboard Organisms](/assets/drawings/whiteboard-organisms.jpg)
The humble whiteboard beginnings. Pineapple. Daisy. Blueberries. Kiwis. Grapefruit - guess my stance on them. Hey! Don't look at my checklist :boom:
