Yo, this is my first post.
I wanted to motivate myself to work on ideas I have as well as be able to share them with everone at once.  
I figured making a blog would be an okay solution. And I guess I'll name it `Michael's Motive` ðŸŒŸ

Some of the topics I see myself getting into in future posts:

- Artwork
- Music
- Photography
- DIY Projects
- Hardware and Software Projects
- Editorials
- Blogging Meta

I decided to use non-proprietary sites like medium.com so I could have full control over my content and be able to customize to my heart's content. That's part of the fun of running a blog after all, right? I'm not sure this is my first time. I personally feel everyone should have their own websites instead of using these social media platforms like twitter, facebook, instagram, etc. but we're not there yet.

I am not sure what frequency I will be posting, some will take lots of work to finish since they might include an actual piece of software or building something and others be just a spur of the momment post that takes me twenty minutes. I will shoot for two a month to start and will leverage things that I have already done in my past to ensure I can hit this target.

I will learn tons about how to improve at writing, updating and whatnot over the first handful of posts so please be understanding.
