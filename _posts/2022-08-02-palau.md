title: The Republic of Palau

I went through a couple domain names before landing on `micmax.pw`. I use the first three letters of my given name and surname for everything nowadays. It makes for a unique domain & email. Thanks Palau for the TLD! I plan on sticking with this one until death does me in :skull:

Here is Palau on a map, located northeast of Philippines and Indonesia in the Pacific Ocean.

Most unique TLD's prior to the :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: introduction of `.ninja` and `.pizza` were based on [country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain). They are often used for short URL sites or in combination with the second-level domain to complete a word. YouTube has an example of both `youtu.be` thanks to Belgium. I was going to buy the domain `straw.pl` from Poland to host [my straw poll app](https://strawpoll.xyz), but it got sniped.
