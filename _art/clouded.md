The first image was generated from Dalle-2 mini from a prompt like "guy being sad clouds raining tears" and I made a few variations on the resulting image, the first matching the 256px resolution for some reason... I really liked the style and made the original my [Chess.com profile](https://www.chess.com/member/micmax) picture.
