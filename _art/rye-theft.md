Inspired by [my favourite scene in Seinfeld](https://youtu.be/QfuuXwQMDyE) and the age-old classic PSA [Piracy. It's a crime](https://youtu.be/HmZm8vNHBSU) which was superseded by the [you wouldn't download a car meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/751150-piracy-its-a-crime). I am a proud user of `thepiratebay`, just ask my ISP! Quickly drew this at Cal Anderson Park.
