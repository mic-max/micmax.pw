One of my [favourite movies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246578/), I remember first watching this with my older sister @heathermaxwelll and being so confused. I've since rewatched it a bunch of times, went as Donnie for `Hallowe'en 2017`, and during my last rewatch session at `2AM` was inspired to draw this.
