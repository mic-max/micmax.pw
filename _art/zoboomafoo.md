Another classic show from my childhood. This actually became the basis for my online identity `Lemur` (mispronounced by many) starting in `~2011`. [Sifaka Lemurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sifaka) are my favourite animal and I drew this on a weekend trip to [Pacific City, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_City,_Oregon). I'm not too happy how this one turned out, too much solid colour.
