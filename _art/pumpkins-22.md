My pumpkin is on the right and my date's was on the left. We went to Carpinito Bros. Pumpkin Patch and Corn Maze on October 23 and then carved them on my garbage bag covered kitchen floor. I started this drawing before she broke things off, so that's why it took me a month extra to finish it for myself. Her spider web was not as good as my drawing would have you believe by the way --- not being petty :wink:
