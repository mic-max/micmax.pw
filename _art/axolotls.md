One of my favourite animals. I did a speech on the [Mexican Axolotl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl) in Grade 5 after seeing them in a magazine and being fascinated with them. I got a pencil case from a store in `Bellevue` which is how I  store my markers, this is a recreation of that design. `PS: Minecraft is stealing my thoughts...`
