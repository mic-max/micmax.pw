I was thinking about pros and cons of liquid soap and one I considered was I could have all my shower liquids in a pump station on the wall to clean up the edge of the tub. What if I took it to the extreme though and sneakily put my favourite liquids in there and used just one for some men's 3-in-1. That would be quite the devious and sneaky little maneuver. This is every man's dream whether they admit to it or not and I was inspired to draw it.
