I broke my shower tap. Now it's just this metal thing. Luckily I had a spare wrench and have been using that, just as my landlord ended up suggesting!

It's not very classy or as convenient though. Time to print something up! First I replicated the part that went over the metal arm to make the prototyping phase faster. Once that piece was worked out I extended some knobs off it for the final product.
