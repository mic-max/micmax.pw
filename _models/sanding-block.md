I saw a YouTube short showing these off and they looked handy. [The design](https://www.printables.com/model/47712-small-sanding-block) calls for some nuts and bolts which I don't have any kits, so purchased [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BMPR9Y6J) which should come in handy for future projects too. Creating two [better knobs](https://www.printables.com/model/60406-a-better-knob-for), two caps, a body, and a holder will require `20g` PLA filament, a `1"` thick sandpaper strip, two `M4x20` bolts, and four `M4` nuts. I ended up [Gorilla gluing](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22291160) the bottom nut. I used so much that it impacted the fit of the caps and had to cut away at the solidified glue with a knife and sand the base flat. I also labelled them with their grit using my Dymo I've been obsessed with.
