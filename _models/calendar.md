I recently started watching some [elliot is a cool guy]() content on YouTube and in [his most recent video](https://youtu.be/v2QfOkixp4k?t=160) (which was an absolute masterpiece) he showed his calendar which I had to have it.

Create a circumscribed polygon (square) from the top and make it about `92%` of the height. For example, if the diameter is `24 mm` make the height of the rectangle only `22 mm`.

After playing around in Fusion 360 for the best way to build this I reverse image searched the inspiration like Nev trying to sniff out a stinky [catfish](https://www.mtv.com/shows/catfish-the-tv-show). I found it and by God was it a good thing I own a 3D printed and know the basics of CAD design because it's a 165 euro!

I also learned from the closeups on their site that each date where the ring sits is slightly less proud to the original simple cylinder with fillet at bottom idea I first thought of. Should still be a simple adjustment.

My printer has a bed of `256 mm` x `256 mm` so I will not be able to clone the `473 mm` x `485 mm` item in one print. Some other key dimensions I got was the height being `54 mm`. I can use these to help figure out the ratios and spacing. I could also try printing it at original scale and split the design into 4 pieces. I plan on mounting this magnetically to my air conditioning unit in my new apartment so I might not even have to glue or secure the piece together, just use some extra magnets! 12mm magnet insets into the back at each corner, CA glue in magnets I have from a folding chess set.

lagging rectangular pattern from a bunch of features. better to pattern the sketch. then make all the bodies.
Centering text in a circle - pleasing to the eye.

Different size font for month and weekday vs date

Font to pick! The original uses a variation of Clarendon according to the [What the Font](https://www.myfonts.com/pages/whatthefont) - my first time using it, and definitely not the last!

- Georgia
- Javanese
- Microsoft Himalaya
- Myanmar Text
- Palatino Linotype Bold
- SimSun
- Trebuchet MS

After brief consideration, in WordPad, of all these fonts I am going with Trebuchet MS. It's a satisfactory font, and a pretty weapon.

For some reason in the original the only words abbreviated to 4 letters were june and july. Maybe because they are the only 4 letter months and week day names? I think I will still make them to be 3 and go with jun and jul because its pretty obvious which is which.
