While looking up why my Dyson only last 10 seconds on maximum suck mode I found it was due to an old battery. So after buying [this new one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HWR1KNY) I wanted to be able to easily swap them without using the 3 small phillips screws and stumbled across [this model](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/home/dyson-v6-quick-change-battery-clip). Unfortunately, it is for the wrong Dyson version, but I was inspired to create my own!

The first attempt needed some fine tuning as seen by the gaps and the bottom clip not being able to fully close. I believe the top didn't have enough clearance so I will make sure I increase that.

I tried getting a good shape of the profile by wrapping a wire around, thought not precise it gave me an idea and made me feel like [MacGyver](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088559/).

There's the final version.

This project also introduced me to `cults3d.com` which has an online marketplace you can sell your models on, of which I'm sure there are others. Did I hear passive income :money_eyes:
