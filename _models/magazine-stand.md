I found out about [this cool magazine](https://www.lulu.com/shop/be%C3%B1at-iturbe/looney-tunes-backgrounds-zine/paperback/product-2y9wmq.html?page=1&pageSize=4) after following the instagram account [looneytunesbackgrounds](https://www.instagram.com/looneytunesbackgrounds) since I, not unlike the [self-administering coked up rats](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4156291/) TODO, need my fix of nostalgia. Anyway, this magazine is a collection of "heartfelf remakes" to some of the classics by a group of artists, one which I recognized being @glanderco. If I put this on display in my apartment people will think I am interesting and then they will like me.
