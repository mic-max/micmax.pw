I added a bunch of hexagon holes to the piece so it would print faster... That's apparently a [myth](https://markforged.com/resources/blog/design-for-3d-printing-part-3-decreasing-print-time). They only save on material. That blog post says a good rule of thumb is adding surface area, which the "speed holes" do, increases print time.

Do the speed holes add surface area?
