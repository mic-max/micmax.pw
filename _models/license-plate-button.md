I suspected one of these would fall off, thanks to the powerful cleaning powers of Brown Bear Car Wash on 15th Ave W. It is a pretty simple design, the goal of making it friction fit will be the real challenge. Luckily since it is a very small part I should be able to turn out quick iterations if I don't nail it the first time :crossed_fingers:

Measurements:

- Exterior Diameter: `18.55mm`
- Edge Height: `5.22mm`
- Full Height: `6.99mm`
- Interior Diameter: `15.30mm`
- Interior Next Diameter: `14.67mm`
- Depth: `5.24mm` (seems to match edge height)
