The [kit of nuts and bolts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BMPR9Y6J) I bought arrived in a completely entropic state despite the organiser box it came in's best efforts. To fight entropy I printed [this metric nut and bolt measuring tool](https://www.printables.com/model/36887-metric-screw-bolt-and-nut-measuring-tool) that will be stress tested on 480 pieces! Unfortunately I didn't switch to black filament when it started oozing on the glyphs, so I _precisely_ used a black pen.
