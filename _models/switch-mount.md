Both this and the next item were custom designed for cleaning up the power and networking cables in my TV unit. First, I have a D-Link 5-port network switch that connects my TV, Xbox, Sonos Soundbar, PC to my router.

Tips I learned from making these:

- Make sure all parts of your design that you want to be solid, are.
- Imagine actually using it, my first design I needed to drill a screw through a hole that was too close to another feature so the screw couldn't go in straight.
- Generic hot glue doesn't hold too well...
- Try not to over-engineer a solution.
- Shapr 3D has no good plan for hobbyists. $30/month is not reasonable.

I realized now the ultimate setup for clean cables is no cables at all. I'm running all WiFi now :sweat_smile:
