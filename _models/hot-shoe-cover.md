I lost it! I've been using a little battery powered LED light that I got from work and use mainly for the odd work video call I make. I thought I stored it with my other camera stuff but it's not there. Luckily, [printing another](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/sony-a6000-a7-hot-shoe-cover) should be piece of cake. I am now also noticing the LED light has 3 additional hot shoe mounts on it which I could have used to store the cover... Oh well, c'est la vie!
