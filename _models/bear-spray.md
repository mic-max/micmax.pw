For @katiekatie12341. She asked if I could print and mail her a safety clip for her bear spray since they don't ship to Canada. C'mon [UDAP](https://udap.com), figure it out! Anyways, the model was already available on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:175620) so printed this at 15% infill and with four shells as the creator recommended. Mailed to her friend in North Vancouver and hopefully know her bear spray never goes off unintentionally :smile:

PS: I was happy to help and more just happy to be thought of as someone people are comfortable reaching out to and asking for my help :blush:
