Hello, my name is `Michael Ian Maxwell` and I was born on the `0x70`<sup>th</sup> [Groundhog Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day#Punxsutawney_beginnings) :sunflower:  
I am from `Ottawa, Canada` :maple_leaf: and currently live in `Seattle, USA` :umbrella:  
If you're curious what I look like; a little something like this üë®‚Äçü¶∞ and vertically blessed

I enjoy :runner::bike:üèí:soccer::ski:ü•ç:video_game:, coding projects :computer:, hackathons :sleeping:, and technology ‚öô in general

I work for `Microsoft` as a `Software Engineer` :sunglasses:
