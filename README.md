## Website To Do List

- SEO Optimization
- Media Images - When sharing a post on Twitter for example the image and description shown are correct
- Table of Contents for longer posts
- Pagination - I currently think I should not use this
- Use alt text and descriptions for images - Making the site more accessible to users and web scrapers
- Compress and resize images to reduce load time and bandwidth
- Allow both light and dark mode depending on user preference
- Show time to read at top of blog post
- Show tags and categories at top of blog post
- Jekyll water.css theme [Github Issue](https://github.com/kognise/water.css/issues/18)
- Title being "*the blog post title* | Michael's Motive" is probably too long - shorten this ðŸ˜Š
- Include Twitter feed
- Include Instagram feed
- Include Spotify currently listening to
- Twitch, Discord social links
- Comment section: https://lobste.rs/
- Spelling and grammar checks, GitHub action?
- Dead link checks, GitHub action?
- Uglify / minify generated HTML, CSS, JS
- Bing Verify my site - https://wilsonmar.github.io/jekyll-site-development/
- Google Verify my site - https://wilsonmar.github.io/jekyll-site-development/
- Add friend directory, so in a post I can just say their name like everyone knows them and hovering or clicking the link will give a quick introduction to them
