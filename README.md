# Michael's Motive

Welcome to the source code to my website.\
This, like most software nowadays, will never be done.\
To see what I'm working on or planning at any time check [here](https://github.com/mic-max/micmax.pw/projects/1)

## Build

1. Set the environment variable `EDITOR` = `code`
1. Install [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
1. `gem i bundler jekyll`
1. `bundle`
1. `bundle exec jekyll serve [--drafts]`

## Writing

1. `bundle exec jekyll draft "My new draft"`
1. `bundle exec jekyll publish _drafts/my-new-draft.md`

## Spelling Checker

1. `npm i -g spellchecker-cli`
1. `spellchecker -f _posts/*.md -l en-CA -d dictionary.txt -q --no-suggestions`

## Dead Link Checker

1. `gem i deadlink`
1. `deadlink`

## Markdown Lint

1. `gem i mdl`
1. `mdl **/*.md`

## Helper Aliases

Should I add a `package.json` and make these scripts in it?

- `draft <title> <folder>` => `bundle exec jekyll draft "<title>" && mv _drafts/<title>.md _drafts/<folder>/<title>.md`
- `publish <folder> <title>` => `bundle exec jekyll publish _drafts/<folder>/<title>.md`

## Website To Do List

- Misc
  - SEO Optimization <https://jsinibardy.com/optimize-seo-jekyll>
